Currently there is a global need for geotechnical engineers for design and construction of challenging large infrastructure projects. The Geotechnical Engineering major trains students in a variety of skills such as planning and undertaking geotechnical site investigations and laboratory testing, designing major structures in ground, and designing appropriate ground improvement techniques for problematic soils and contaminated sites. The knowledge and skills that students gain prepare them to work in many industries and organisations including local councils, state and federal government, non-government organisations, geotechnical consultancies, construction companies and large multinational firms.This major is mostly suited to applicants who have an undergraduate degree in civil engineering.

The Technology Management major is designed for students who have a technical background or a keen interest in technology and therefore a strong alignment with analytical approaches. From this platform the objectives are underpinned by the desire to expose students to a broader body of knowledge and range of approaches than experienced in a purely technical framework. A key issue is the benefit that accrues from supplementing analytical and mathematical modelling approaches with business and social science skills. Much of the value and strength of the Technology Management major relate to consideration of approaches and perceptions that are extensions of, or build upon, an engineering/scientific view point. The differences between technocratic approaches and human and societal constructs are brought into sharp focus broadening the perspectives of students. The major is specifically designed to enhance understanding of the need for technology, people and society to be viewed as closely interrelated aspects of all engineering and business activity.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">MAJ03427</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">2</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">AC</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Telecommunications is an integral part of modern society.

The dwindling supply of water is being caused by factors such as population growth, climate change, poor investment in infrastructure, and management problems. Water engineers are looking for solutions to this water crisis as well as working on other important issues such as protecting eco-systems, and improving rural and urban environments.Water engineers and managers now require a much broader understanding of water issues. The purpose of the Water Engineering major is to provide engineers and scientists with expert up-to-date knowledge in the fields of water resources management, hydraulics, and hydrology in both urban and rural environments. It is intended to enable students to update their expertise, to appreciate the environmental implications of water schemes, and to develop management skills.There has been a major shortage of water engineers both in Australia and abroad over the last decade so employment opportunities are vast. There are jobs available in local councils, state and federal government, non-government organisations, small and large consultancies as well as large multinational firms. This major is mostly suited to applicants who have an undergraduate degree in civil engineering, however applicants with a background in other fields of engineering and/or applied science may also apply.Awarding of this major on an academic transcript also requires the completion of a graduate project in this broad discipline area.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">MAJ03372</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">2</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">AC</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">One of today's most prominent challenges, both on a global and a local scale, is the scarcity of water.
