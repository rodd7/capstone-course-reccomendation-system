In order to obtain a detailed understanding of 4G network performance, telecommunication engineers must have a solid understanding of 4G network structure, function and behaviour. As part of the learning outcomes in this subject, students acquire fundamental knowledge of 4G mobile networks and learn to apply industry tools and techniques by problem solving, designing and validating the practical performance of a commercial 4G network. This subject provides an introduction to 4G/5G LTE networks as well as details of the architecture, air-interface, protocols, quality of service, radio resource management and services. Students can also undertake a globally recognised industry certification &ndash; Nokia Certified Network Associate in LTE Networks &ndash; by undertaking an additional external examination. The subject is independent of any specific 4G/5G mobile network vendor and is based on industry LTE standards.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject delivery consists of tutorials, quizzes and laboratories. It is the responsibility of the student to read UTSOnline regularly, watch the lecture videos, study the subject resources, and answer the review questions .The students gain first exposure to new material outside of class, usually via subject readings and lecture videos on UTSOnline, and then class time is used for tutorials to answer questions and for assimilating that knowledge through strategies such as quizzes, problem-solving, presentations, discussion or debates. Practical work related to 4G network performance is performed by students outside class times in groups to encourage collaborative learning. The subject is designed so that students engage with the subject material with mid-session and final quizzes. This organisation results in continuous self-assessment throughout the session to ensure that student learning is appropriate and &lsquo;on-track&rsquo;. Past experience has shown that students who miss key learning activities have a high chance of failure. We expect that students play an active part in their learning in the subject and adhere to the principles of good academic practice. This means that students should come to all of the class sessions well prepared. Go through the lecture videos and subject resources BEFORE coming to class. Take an active part in the class and engage with the learning activities &ndash; students should not simply be passive observers! The exams and quizzes assume that students have completed the readings and lecture videos along with the the lecture notes. UTSOnline will be used in this subject for online group discussions and subject announcements. The teaching strategy consists of fortnightly classes made up of a one hour tutorial in which students are invited to clear doubts regarding the lecture material covered to date and material explored outside class. Design tasks are then undertaken to apply concepts.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Based on a NOKIA curriculum which contained the following modules: 1. E2E Architecture Introduction, 2.

In the first week, students inform themselves on available projects, clarify project expectations, choose a project and form groups using UTSOnline. At the start of the session, students will attend a class on methodological issues and introduce their projects and groups. Throughout the remainder of the session, students develop their projects through collaborative group work assisted by weekly group meetings with their project mentors/sponsors. These meetings are a valuable source of verbal feedback and give students the opportunity to clarify their understanding and to discuss their research to gain deeper considerations to include in their projects. To complement the project based learning and to provide formal feedback, students will be able to access reading materials and a discussion board on UTSOnline and submit written reports (see activates detailed in the assessment section) and deliver formal presentations of the project outcomes at the end of the session.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In this subject students will apply Data Analytics Methodologies (CRISP-DM, SEMMA), Data Analytics Project Management (resource allocation, working in teams, planning, running meetings), use their skills for Data Interpretation and Communication of Results.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The following books are strongly recommended. 1.

The process consists of several iterative steps, including data pre-processing and transformation, the actual data mining and pattern discovery steps, and putting discovered information and knowledge into action. This subject is focused on the practical implementation of this process to large data sets from different areas of human endeavour. It provides students with exposure to real-world analytics scenarios, and with expertise and experience in the application of the data mining techniques and in professional communication of analytics results. Students choose a real-world project of interest and, with the help of a staff mentor, research, plan and produce an outcome. They communicate the results of the project in a detailed report.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject involves independent and self-motivated work by the student, assisted by the student&#39;s individual project supervisor and the subject co-ordinator. Student and supervisor will develop a learning contract by week 3 where they agree on the tasks and scope of the project and form a plan for doing the project. The learning contract shall be a statement containing: the title of the proposed project; the aim of the project; a list of tasks to be carried out by the student to fulfil the project aims; and a set of milestones and delivery dates. Projects shall be of real-world significance and it is intended that the project report would be of sufficient quality to demonstrate data analytics competence to a prospective employer. Students will need to do some background research in the problem area and methods to be used under the guidance of the mentor to be able to solve the problem in the agreed project. The depth of research will be gauged by the mentor so as to match the level of work required in a 6 credit point undergraduate subject such as this.  Students will meet regularly with their mentor (weekly or fortnightly) where they will report and receive feedback on their progress, determine how they are tracking against the project plan and whether that plan needs to be modified. Students may collaborate with other students in a meaningful way as need arises but this is not necessary. Mentors are guided by the student needs in the case and will suggest online readings and other research material to aid their project development.

Specifically, the subject provides students with practice in prototyping in teams with an eye on investibility and business factors - the keys to commercialisation. Investibility is defined in this subject as designing a prototypical solution that meets an unmet need (is desirable to people), can be delivered to the market (technically feasible) and can be structured in an appropriate business model (viable business). Together these are the three innovation challenges in this subject. Working in teams, students identify customer needs, design prototypical solutions using the latest design thinking methods and design value, delivery and business propositions. Customer validation is used to refine prototypes and business models throughout the subject that emphasises the commercialisation phase. This subject provides a roadmap for product and business design. Students create prototypical products and services and a project design portfolio that can prepare them for success in other project-based work, in graduate employment, or in startup ventures.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is taught in a series of sprints. Using experiential learning methods, classes are supported by online learning materials and communication tools. Selected content will be available online before class. The face-to-face classes engage students in individual and group work, discussions, reflections, and presentations. Students will also work with others across a variety of disciplines to make progress. Students participate in scrums and sprints. Work targets are set, demonstrated, and evaluated in the scrum meetings. The scrums include weekly reviews, scheduled times where the whole group comes together to critique progress and to plan the next week&#39;s sprint as well as times that teams come together to collaborate in the prototyping process. Attendance is expected for each of the face-to-face facilitated sessions and group collaboration sessions. Individual reflective sessions also make up each week. The teams may also meet outside of class time. Verbal communication and collaboration between students and facilitators are essential parts of any real-world design challenge or project development, and is integral here, particularly during the weekly scrums and sprints. Facilitator(s) and student peers may be present during each scrum to guide progress and to provide constructive feedback on each individual&rsquo;s progress, to inform improved performance towards the next sprint. These reviews, including descriptions of progress, challenges and artefacts, must be documented in a Design Portfolio. Outside the scheduled class times, students will continue to work on their projects with each other, accessing the classroom and other facilities as needed.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">As a tech founder, what are your motivations or passions and how will you develop yourself, your team and your business for commercial success?

UX is defined as a person&#39;s perceptions and responses that result from the use of a digital product, system or service. Understanding how to approach UX in design is a major focus in interaction design because the quality of UX can affect people&#39;s adoption of a particular designed technology. For many technology design companies, paying attention to how people experience their products is the edge that can potentially set them apart from their competition. However, designing UX effectively is difficult because the term UX is very problematic, meaning very different things to different people, in academic research and in industry. UX is often just the trendy term to define usability. Firstly, students are provided with some conceptual tools to help them talk about UX productively: to identify, describe, analyse and critique real-life experiences with various types of digital technologies. To put these skills into practice, students are introduced to a range of current and emergent human-computer interactions such as mobile and social computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, quantified self, and the &#39;internet of things&#39; (IoT). Through discussing and exploring particular characteristics, interaction styles, affordances, and the ways these technologies are used in our everyday lives, students develop the skills to be able to understand the types of user experiences that arise from people&#39;s interactions with particular technologies, while pursuing specific goals, whether alone or with others, carried out in particular contexts. Through this, they understand how to consider relevant and appropriate user experiences to support when designing for different kinds of human-computer interactions. Students also learn methods, concepts, and techniques used in design activities to support for a specific user experience. This includes user research techniques, sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and evaluation approaches that can support them to design appropriate and engaging user experiences. They hone their skills through responding to a real-world problem, designing a technology solution that not only meets the users&#39; needs effectively but, more importantly, supports desirable and potentially engaging experiences. By building upon students&#39; prior understandings of fundamental interaction design concepts and processes, it is expected that when they successfully complete this subject, they are able to not only design useful and usable technologies, but also technologies that are optimised to support the users&#39; experience. Industry guests working with UX are invited to the lecture/workshop where they participate in informal discussion and answer questions about different aspects of UX in the industry.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is linked with the postgraduate subject 32509 Advanced Interaction Design.

Students learn about considerations relating to volume, capital investment, modern concepts of quality management, and quality control. Modern metrology equipment and methods are also examined. Students of this subject become conversant with aspects of computer systems and software in relation to modern manufacturing, and gain experience with CAD/CAM for CNC machining. Students also investigate some roles of industrial robots in fabrication, welding and assembly.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The student learning development in this subject is through: (1) Preparative work (&ldquo;pre-work&rdquo;), (2) &ldquo;in-class&rdquo; activities, and (3) &ldquo;post-class&rdquo; activities. Of these activities, some are undertaken on-campus and others online. When students participate in these activities, they will develop an understanding of key advanced manufacturing concepts relating to quality in manufacturing, engineering metrology and measurements, automation, production systems, computer-integrated manufacturing, CNC, CAD/CAM, Additive Manufacturing, PLC and robotics. In addition, students will develop an ability to understand, troubleshoot and solve complex manufacturing problems. For each of these topic areas, student learning starts with preparatory activities. In most cases, preparatory documents are available on UTSOnline for students to read prior to the in-class sessions. Second, after students complete their (online) preparatory activities, they will participate in lectures and laboratories. The students will have experience and knowledge exchange through forum, social media applications will be a discussion windows. Third, student competency is further developed through &ldquo;post-class&rdquo; problem-based and project-based learning activities including assignments and preparing for the final exam. An illustrative example follows, showing how these learning strategies are intended to work together to improve learning. During two laboratories, students will use specialised metrology equipment to measure and characterise the dimensions and surfaces of various items and parts. Students already know that manufacturing engineering commonly involves the production of parts or products &ndash; and that those parts or products must invariably meet specified requirements relating to size/surface/smoothness etc. During the two-metrology laboratories, students will gain hands-on experience with different types of metrology equipment. In this way, they will further their understanding of how such measurements are obtained, analysed and interpreted with respect to tolerance and quality. In addition, by participating in such practical activities, students will further-develop competencies relevant to professional manufacturing engineering practice. In tandem with the laboratories, the lectures will help students to develop their understanding of relevant key concepts. Prior to the in-class activities, students will have engaged with online pre-work that focuses on some introductory concepts and introduces students to &ldquo;must-know&rdquo; aspects of the equipment that they will soon use hands-on. Following the labs, students will produce reports that analyse and reflect on the results of the labs. These post-class activities are intended to help students reinforce their learning, encourage students to undertake additional self-directed research and facilitate student engagement with further self-directed problem solving. This subject also includes a major project, where students will gain further hands-on experience while they design, fabricate, implement, troubleshoot and evaluate their own manufacturing equipment. The group-based nature of the major project is also intended to help further-develop student experience in participating in a collaborative manufacturing engineering setting.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">quality management and tools for quality management metrology, tolerance, CMM computer-aided manufacturing and numerical control of machine tools computer-aided process programming industrial robotics 3D scanning, additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping PLC flexible manufacturing systems computer integrated manufacturing production planning and control ideas; just-in-time, Toyota, Kanban and group technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Reference materials to be available on UTSOnline.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42092</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C04271 Master of Engineering, C04273 Master of Engineering Master of Engineering Manager, C04277 Master of Engineering (Extension): MAJ03534 Electrical Energy Systems; C04278 Master of Engineering (Advanced): MAJ03536 Electrical Energy Systems and C04309 Master of Professional Engineering: MAJ03534 Electrical Energy Systems.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Power electronics interface design and implementation for microgrid, smart grids and modern power systems, has received tremendous attention in recent years.

A research-inspired learning strategy is adopted in this subject for group activities, including the major research project. To motivate students to learn disciplinary research skills, research inspired assessment tasks are adopted. As an example, different research projects are allocated to groups of students after meeting with them face-to-face. Students will form themselves in small groups and discuss the research project and do brainstorming, providing a collaborative learning experience. Students can directly connect the defined research projects to one or some of the sessions hence, they can gain a deeper understanding of the topics involved in the subject through research based learning. Constructive feedback on the progress of the project will be given early on, therefore students can address the comments in their final submissions. Students are encouraged to use the new collaborative spaces available at UTS to facilitate the required collaborative group work for planning and presenting the major research project.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject covers the following content areas:  Ground Investigation and New and Conventional Laboratory and In-situ Tests Stress paths for drained and undrained traditional triaxial compression loading conditions Time-dependent loading; radial drainage and wick drains; vertical consolidation under combined vertical and radial drainage Critical State Soil Mechanics and Soil Plasticity Introduction to Unsaturated Soil Mechanics Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Geotechnics Elastic and Visco-Plastic Deformation of Shallow Footings Application of Numerical Modelling in Foundation Design Bearing Capacity and Settlement Calculations of Pile Groups Design of Pile Foundations under Lateral Loading</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">A set of lecture slides covering the topics is provided to students on UTSOnline.

Especially with the identification of emerging pollutants, swift growth of population and industrial activities, and lessening availability of water resources, conventional treatment processes are becoming more challenged. Practitioners in the field need to establish best practices in handling water and wastewater from different sources to combat the modern challenges in industry. This subject focuses on educating students on how to design an advanced water and wastewater treatment process using membrane technology based on fundamental principles to real applications and process design parameters. A practical computer-based design tool is demonstrated to aid in the design of a membrane-based treatment process. The subject brings both science (chemistry, physics and biology) and engineering together on a number of levels, such as in terms of learning from nature, and applying engineering and design solutions.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Teaching and learning strategies consist of formal lectures combined with pre-work sessions and in-class tutorials, group discussions, online readings, a field trip and individual assignments to help students understand new concepts. The subject is organised into three groups of two intensive face-to-face sessions (3 h + 8 h) to cover the three modules that compose the subject. The class is designed with a combination of pre-work and face-to-face sessions (lectures, tutorials, and group work/discussions during lectures), a special visit to water and wastewater treatment plant, and scenario-based assessment tasks to facilitate student learning. An example of pre-work activity is watching videos from UTSOnline about the membrane bioreactor process for wastewater treatment. During the preparatory week (Week 1), students should watch the introductory video in preparation for the block classes. There will be preparation activities listed on UTSOnline prior to each block, which includes watching videos and reading online materials. Related questions will also be posted, in which students are required to engage to facilitate in-class discussions among students and to be moderated by the lecturer for self-assessment and evaluation. Further feedback for individual learning will be made available through individual appointment with the teaching staff. Class lectures are fully interactive in nature, wherein collaborative learning is utilised through in-class group discussions for each lecture module. The class will be divided into small groups and will be given guiding questions related to the lecture topic as well to the pre-work material. Students will discuss amongst themselves for about 20-30 min and answer collectively as a group. The teaching staff will divide the time joining each group for discussion. After the group discussions, a representative from each group will present their arguments to the class for further discussion and explanation of their answers. During such presentations, there will be opportunity for peer assessment and feedback by opening the floor for questions and comments from students of other groups for about 15-20 min. This activity allows students to share their knowledge, assess their understanding and receive direct peer and staff feedback, build their communication skills, and consolidate the concepts learned. The group discussions also provide a guide for the preparation of their arguments and discussion in their assessment tasks. There will also be a computer laboratory tutorial lessons for learning computer-based design software, which will give the students the opportunity to interact amongst themselves and with the teaching staff for understanding the design procedures and concepts, and receiving direct feedback. Assessment tasks are designed to further students&rsquo; learning of the topics covered. Learning Resource Materials (LRM) will be provided on UTSOnline during the preparatory week, which includes pre-recorded videos, references to external websites, video tutorials, or text/notes on the module in Word, PDF or Powerpoint format. Assigned readings will be given to students before each block session with open-ended questions that will be discussed during lecture time. Students are expected to attend lecture sessions, participate actively in all tutorial components as well as group discussions and complete assessment tasks by their due dates.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject covers additional topics not covered in other environmental and water related engineering subjects and therefore aims to impart students with investigative and design skills in advanced water and wastewater treatment processes using membrane technology that are expected of water and environmental engineers.

Students learn about the key role that engineering plays in understanding the sources and impacts of air and noise pollution, and implementing methods of control. The subject objectives are met by enabling students to master underpinning theory, develop problem-solving and communication skills, undertake research work independently and in a team, and complete laboratory investigations. The subject is delivered in two modules with the first component focusing on air pollution and the second on noise pollution.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Students will learn in this subject through a combination of lectures, tutorials, laboratories and independent learning activities. This course is delivered in intensive Block Mode and is taught over 4.5 days, consisting of 3 full days and 3 half days. Independent learning activities: Preparatory study before attending each block session is essential. Students should aim to spend 2 hours studying subject materials for each hour spent in the classroom. The independent reading and learning resource material will be provided within UTSOnline for students to complete in advance of their attendance at a block session. Based on their independent study of subject materials, students bring knowledge to class that can be shared and critiqued and also used as a basis for problem solving activities. Written feedback will be provided for both formative and summative assessment tasks. Laboratories: Successful deployment of appropriate monitoring instrumentation and use of modelling software is essential for successfully undertaking air and noise pollution investigations in professional engineering practice. To develop these skills, students undertake two laboratory practical sessions (one each for both the air and noise pollution components of this course) as well as a three hour laboratory in contaminant dispersion modelling. These activities gives students practical experience with relevant technologies used in air and noise pollution assessments. After completing the three laboratory sessions, students prepare an individual report (on the topic of their choice) outlining the aims of the investigation, the experimental and mathematical tools they used they to meet the specified objectives, as well as presenting and discussing their results along with any limitations of their approach. Lectures: Comprehensive lecture materials will be made available to students in advance of each block session so they can be studied and reviewed outside of formal class hours. A primary means of knowledge transfer in this subject will be through in-class problem solving sessions. As such, class time will extend and apply (and not duplicate) the learning outcomes that students have obtained based on their self-study of lecture materials. Tutorials: A significant fraction of class time within each block session will be devoted to whole-of-class and group based problem solving activities. After completing tutorials, students will not only obtain a strong understanding of the relevant theory that underpins air and noise pollution, but will be able to apply these principles in practical engineering situations. Tutorial sessions will also equip students with the skills they need to undertake problem-based research work both independently and as part of a team and to communicate their results in written and oral formats. Students will receive feedback on their progress with the group report and presentation whilst working in their groups during tutorial sessions.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The main topics that will be covered in this subject are: &bull; Air pollution effects on human health and the environment &bull; Key pollutants and their sources &bull; Effect of meteorology on the dispersion of pollutants &bull; Air pollution measurement &bull; Air pollution control &bull; Indoor air quality &bull; Air pollution and global climate change &bull; Acoustic principles &bull; Effects of noise on human health &bull; Environment related noise &bull; Workplace related noise &bull; Aircraft related noise &bull; Pubs and clubs related noise &bull; Noise control engineering &bull; Vibration control &bull; Noise measurement &bull; Noise-induced hearing loss &bull; Traffic noise The actual content delivered in this subject may vary in any particular teaching session based on the professional experience and prior learning obtained by students.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There is no required text for this subject.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">49322</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Airconditioning systems are required by modern society and they need to be functional, well-controlled, and energy-efficient, to maintain human comfort and health, industrial productivity, while minimising their environmental impact.

The first 6 classes cover foundational Android concepts and are designed to get the student up to speed with Android development. These classes will consist of a 1 hour lecture followed by a 2 hour lab. Students are expected to study weekly videos and readings on UTSOnline before attending class, which will form the basis of class discussions and exercises. In the lecture, the weekly topic is discussed and students are invited to ask questions to further their understanding. In the lab, students work on a programming exercise together with other students. In this activity, students will not only apply the techniques that they have learnt from the videos, readings and lectures, but will also research and apply new techniques from the Internet as needed. In the labs, students will also do regular peer reviews and assessments of each other&#39;s work. The peer review sessions allow students to learn new techniques from each other, and they also help students to develop a more critical eye for quality code.  With the exception of the week 8 mid-session test and the week 12 final project demos, the remaining classes will each consist of a 3 hour lab supporting the students&#39; development of their final Android projects. In class, students will work on their individual applications and are encouraged to ask the instructor for feedback and also for help with any technical issues. Although students will work individually on different ideas of their own choosing, students will also be expected to share with their peers any useful new programming techniques that they have discovered through their research. These classes are an opportunity to learn new techniques from other students as well as from the instructor. Outside of class, students are also encouraged to share new programming techniques on the UTSOnline discussion board. Each week, students will be required to show the instructor the progress they have made during the week, and it is expected that students come to class prepared with specific questions to ask about their projects.  Classes will run in the collaborative pod classrooms to facilitate communication and interaction between students while working on the exercises and projects. These rooms are not equipped with lab machines, and so students will be expected to bring their own laptops to class with Android Studio installed.

The subject resources provide background information on the Timber Structures Code (AS1720.1-2010) and comprehensive &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; design procedures for beams, columns, poles, connections and manufactured timber products. Students will need to either purchase or access copies of AS1720.1 and HB108. The online self-paced lecture material covers topics such as production of the resources, understanding of basic element design and extending this knowledge to the design of specific structural systems, such as structural elements and systems that create timber based -residential and commercial buildings. Students must use the provided resources in the same way as a graduate engineer seeking to develop specialist knowledge by self-learning. The face-to-face teaching blocks will then be used to provide discussion and clarify any queries about content and to facilitate applying that knowledge to develop design solutions for real-world buildings. The presenter will be a facilitator/adviser to help students develop the skills and competencies required to successfully complete the design tasks. A number of resources &ndash; particularly the EXPAN design guides, represent the current &ldquo;state-of-the-art&rdquo; for design of commercial timber structures and are the outcomes of recently completed, large scale research and development projects undertaken by UTS and partner universities.

It is not a conventional subject guided by a curriculum. Its purpose is to provide an environment in which students can translate the knowledge they have or can gain into what they can do. This is the first studio in the applications stage of the Data and Electronic Engineering majors. The majors have six such studios, two in each of the stages: fundamentals; applications; and professional. Studios are product-based subjects, largely conducted in the studio, in collaboration with other students, academic staff and industry mentors. Students do a combination of individual self-directed study and project work as a team. The stages of the projects are the means by which students learn how to apply their knowledge to what they can achieve. The stages follow the classic engineering paradigm of assess, design and implement. The individual tasks are guided by a learning contract established at the beginning of the session. What differentiates the Applications Studios from the Fundamental Studios is the expectation of the level of proficiency of students. Student will have completed two Fundamental Studios and a range of coursework subjects. This is expected to have given students skills and knowledge that will allow them to undertake the development of more challenging products. What differentiates the applications studios from the fundamentals studios is the expectation of the level of proficiency of students. Once students have completed two fundamentals studios and a range of coursework subjects, it is expected that they have the skills and knowledge to allow them to undertake the development of more challenging products.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The Studio is carried out through two parallel activities &ndash; Individual and Team. Individual  Having joined a Team, and selected a Team Product/Prototype, the individual enters into an Individual Learning Contract (ILC). The individual first assessment (10%) occurs after 3 weeks and is the point at which the student agrees to the ILC with the academic mentor. The second individual assessment (30%) occurs at the end of the session. The learning outcomes are assessed against what was agreed to in the contract. The students &ldquo;teach&rdquo; the class activity. The student will have an opportunity to revisit the ILC during the session if required.  Team At the beginning of the session the Team selects a Product/Prototype to complete.  The Product/Prototype will have an Owner, who will work with the Team in a guiding and mentoring role. The Team&rsquo;s objective is to meet the Owner&rsquo;s expectations in an innovative way that still follows good engineering practice. Teams are encouraged to think outside the box. The Team is responsible for managing their project, ensuring they meet their reporting and timeline objectives. The Team reports their work in a UTSOnline WiKi. This must be done in an ongoing and timely way. The first part of the WiKi is the Proposal, and is assessed after 3 weeks. Then the entire WiKi forms the &ldquo;written&rdquo; part of the deliverable which is assessed together with the Product/Prototype and a Presentation at the end of the Session. The first Team assessment is after 3 weeks and is the Proposal (20%). The final assessment occurs at the end of the session and is of item 5 above (40%).  The faculty expects a commitment of nine hours per week for the Studio, three hours of which occur during scheduled Studio time. Students are expected to attend the three hour sessions each week. This is the time when:  Individual students and staff meet to discuss ILCs and &ldquo;teach&rdquo; the class activities Teams meet with staff to discuss Team progress Teams meet with Product Owners to discuss issues about Products/Prototypes Industry visitors present talks on interesting topics &ldquo;Teach&rdquo; the class sessions occur.  Ultimately learning is the student&#39;s responsibility. It is an aim of this subject to help students develop strategies that will enable them to more effectively undertake the responsibility of learning. These strategies will help students throughout the rest of their course and later in practice.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41087</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C09067 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice/MAJ03518 Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This is the second subject of the &#39;applications studio&#39;.

Online learning activities include practice activities such as online problem sets as well as readings and media watching in preparation for in-class activities. The format of the subject will be a weekly 3-hour class which contains both lecture and workshop/tutorial components. Lectures are used to reinforce and develop key theoretical and practical concepts as well as providing students with the opportunity to work together to solve weekly case studies and recommend the optimum financing/ investment decisions. Lectures are interactive and may contain written, audio and visual content. The collaborative approach enables opportunity for feedback. The tutorial/workshop segment is designed to provide active learning experiences for students where they can discuss their pre-work and problem-solving strategies. In addition, there is an emphasis on self-directed learning through project-based work. This subject is delivered in three modules. The idea behind modules is to link all topics together in a logical sequence. From a managerial perspective, we need to understand the state of the economy, which industry we operate in and the financial health of our firm. This is the first module &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; which applies the top-down approach by analysing the economy, industry then firm by analysing financial statements. After understating the performance of the firm, we need to analyse the source of financing. Module two &lsquo;financing&rsquo; is related to various tools of financing any project including, loans, bonds, preference shares and ordinary shares. Finally, any firm needs to grow or replace depreciated or obsolete machines so the last module &lsquo;valuation&rsquo; is to evaluate the feasibility of expansion or replacement projects by estimating free cash flows, determining appropriate cost of capital, applying capital budgeting techniques and identifying value creation drivers. Out of class activities: This subject requires students to actively engage in learning independently by utilizing the available course material in order to develop mastery of key financial concepts required to develop strategic solutions in a financial analysis and valuation. Students are expected to read and attempt both the problems and the case studies before attending each class in order to actively participate in the discussion. In particular, for case studies students have to discuss their answers in small groups and then submit the group-preferred answer using audience response systems before the class leader provides the solutions and feedback. Lecture slides, practice questions and case studies are available to students via UTSOnline on a weekly basis. In-class activities: The 3-hour collaborative seminar consists of a review of online core materials (pre-work is essential), topic presentations and interactive sessions comprising a mixture of discussions, workshop activities, case studies and informal student presentations. The weekly seminar starts with a short lecture explaining the major concepts using business scenarios to link theoretical concepts to practical application. Lecturer collects questions from the discussion forum prior to each class and discusses them with students during the class. Students may have an opportunity to raise further issues at the start of the class. Then interactive online questions will be answered by students using Kahoot -which is a game-based platform- to test students&rsquo; understanding. This is followed by a group work by analysing short problems and real-world case studies related to lecture material. This may include a class discussion with the class leader acting as a facilitator to stimulate active learning through student interaction and peer discussion. SPARKPLUS: Students are required to create and record a presentation of their analysis and findings. Each group will peer review and provide constructive feedback on 2 presentations. Peer assessment is to be submitted by each group member using the Self &amp; Peer Review Resource Kit (SPARK) accessible via UTS Online. Using the SPARK toolkit each student will answer a series of questions for each group member (including themselves) to rank performance in the presentation. Online Problem Sets: Each week, students are provided with online practice problem sets via UTSOnline to test their understanding of the subject material. These problem sets include a detailed explanation of each answer and thus provide students with immediate feedback. Similar problem sets are also used for assessment, with the solutions and feedback released only after the submission deadline. Discussion Board: This is a web-based resource that can be accessed via the UTSOnline course page. The discussion board is a forum that gives students the opportunity to interact with their peers as well as with teaching staff. Students are able to post questions and comments about the course material. A member of staff will moderate the Forum and will answer students&rsquo; questions when appropriate. UTSOnline: It is a web-based tool used at UTS to provide online learning to students. UTSOnline is accessible by most web browsers and provided you have access to an internet connection you can access UTSOnline anywhere. In the course page, you will be able to:  Download course material (e.g. lecture notes, practice questions, case studies, etc.); Access the Online Problem Sets; Interact with peers and teaching staff (via Discussion Board); Keep up to date (via Announcements).

The subject focuses primarily on computational modelling in orthopaedics biomechanics, and the students learn to use a finite element modelling software to model a musculoskeletal joint in healthy, pathological/traumatic, and clinically treated (with or without implant) states. The subject runs in a Studio mode over 12 weeks. Students form groups of two and choose a specific musculoskeletal disorder as their project topic, and investigate the problem from a clinical, epidemiological, and biomechanical (theoretical and computational modelling) perspectives. The basics of finite element analysis is also discussed. There are guest lectures from clinicians and biomechanics experts in the field. Students are assessed on a mid-term report and presentation (25%) due in Week 5, and a final presentation and report (50%) due in Week 12 along with the solved finite element models (25%).</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In a weekly delivery mode, there are 4 hours of lectures and 3-hour tutorials/drop-in sessions. Lectures will be delivered by the subject coordinator and other professionals working in the field. Face-to-face classes, which take place in a collaborative classroom, which will encourage interactive learning and understanding, as fundamentals of computational modelling in orthopaedics biomechanics can be explained to the class using different methods and illustrations. Students will gain first-hand information during the lectures and will be able to seek personalised guidance on their respective projects during the drop-in sessions. Mid-term presentation and report will ensure that the students remain on track for timely completion of their projects, and special emphasis on the final report will help students refine their research report writing skills. The subject will challenge students on their understanding of concepts in physics and mechanics and will offer them the opportunity to apply some of the concepts into understanding the biomechanical consequences of musculoskeletal disorders.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Musculoskeletal systems in human body Basics of finite element modelling in Strand7 Comparing theoretical and numerical solutions (beam example) Long-bone fracture modelling Mathematical modelling of musculoskeletal joints Theory behind finite element modelling Radiology and other diagnostic techniques in orthopaedics Towards building patient-specific finite element models</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42060</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C04271 Master of Engineering, C04273 Master of Engineering Master of Engineering Management, C04277 Master of Engineering (Extension) - MAJ03476 Biomedical Engineering; C04278 Master of Engineering (Advanced) - MAJ03490 Biomedial Engineering; C04309 Master of Professional Engineering - MAJ03512 Biomedical Engineering.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Biomedical Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject introduces students to the various frameworks, procedures and regulations that are commonplace within the biotech/medical device industry.

The study of these instruments is limited to three major applications: cardiovascular disease and disability. For each area, students study its physiological or electrophysiological aspects and background, measurements of biopotentials and critical-care analytes for monitoring and diagnostic purposes, principles and design of biomedical devices for therapeutic purposes, and new developments for better treatment or assessment in the real world. The subject also aims to encourage the practice of good design.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There are three modules (see below) that encourage students to learn by using technological advances in this subject: background to neural networks and fuzzy logic, intelligent systems and advanced applications. As this is a hands on real world practice oriented subject, active learning opportunities are at its centre. There will be eight (1.5 hrs) sessions of lectures and tutorials, nine (1.5 hrs) project sessions, and two seminar sessions. The seminar sessions are Project Presentations. For this project work, students are required to apply electronic instrumentation, software coding or scientific evaluation of one practical biomedical project of their interest area. Each project may concern the development of a biomedical instrumentation equipment (e.g. a wireless biosignal monitor), a biomedical control system, a health-based software system (e.g. a health-based iPhone app), or a health evaluation system (e.g. evaluation of driver fatigue). The subject is organised so that students collaborate from week to week. They select their joint project within the provided framework, which they will research and work on together for the duration of the subject, present as a group, yet submit as an individual report with their interpretations and explanations. Designated weekly UTSOnline information and YouTube clips are to be accessed prior to class. Lectures, tutorials and Biomedical Instrumentation Labs are used to discuss this information, to answer any questions and to provide support and ongoing feedback. Students post questions on the UTSOnline forum and these will be discussed during class. Feedback is provided before the submission of each Assessment Task and therefore on a weekly basis as per attached Program. Students bring in draft versions of Assessment Task 1 and receive verbal feedback for improvement before the due date.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The first module is concerned with the physiological background of the human nervous system, the heart and circulatory system. The second module covers design objectives for various electrophysiological instrumentation and devices, in particular electromyography (EMG), electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiograms (ECG). It includes the principles of general biomedical instruments for monitoring and assessment of the human body. The third module concerns advanced applications of some of the above instruments. The design and development of hands-free control systems will be discussed, for applications such as environmental control units (ECU), power wheelchairs and fatigue.

A major concern of businesses is the search for competitive advantage and how to best leverage IT resources and align them with business goals to achieve competitive advantage. For IT managers, this raises a number of complex issues to understand and manage. These issues relate to the roles of IT and IT strategy in enabling business processes and generating business benefits. In this subject, theories and methods related to the value of IT are presented and explored. Students learn and discuss business and strategy processes that lead to learning organisations that can achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Business processes and IT strategy are key concerns for business and IT managers. Managing information is a critical skill for success in today&#39;s business environment. Managers need to know about their organisation&#39;s capabilities and uses of information resources. This subject aims to provide a foundation to help general business managers become knowledgeable participants in decision-making processes related to information systems (IS). Critically reviewing the contributions of IS resources in businesses and organisational settings establishes a contextual understanding of how IS permeates many aspects of business. Through case studies this subject reinforces material provided in lectures and tutorials, additional research, and prior knowledge while giving groups of students scope to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking and organisational skills as well as peer learning. The subject stresses the development and assessment of real-world experience through applied and innovative tasks and with team effort. Students develop the knowledge and skills required for using and managing information within an organisation as well as management and communication skills.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject will be taught by a combination of lectures (1.5 hours), tutorials (1.5 hours), individual and group work. It is a Faculty guideline that a 6-credit point subject requires a 9-hour weekly study load, which includes attending lectures and tutorials. This subject involves 3 hours of lectures and tutorials plus 6 hours of study outside class (which includes both individual and team work). Students are strongly advised to consider this workload when planning their academic effort this session. Students are required to complete all assessment tasks through in-class/tutorial activities: group work on a given case study during the tutorial sessions and out of class activities: UTSOnline discussion board and self-directed learning using Internet/handouts/workbook. Student learning is facilitated by a combination of face-to-face and online learning. Students are expected to undertake pre-work before each weekly session, which is available in UTSOnline. This involves reading selected textbook chapters, research articles, and watching Lynda.com courses related to the topic covered in lectures and tutorials. This is followed by a discussion during the tutorial. The lectures contain a collection of specifically focused collaborative in-class activities and exercises. Learning activities in lectures also include practice MCQs questions and review questions at the end of the lecture. In tutorials, students engage in small group discussions and are required to provide the answers to the assigned case study. These discussions draw out key issues of the topic. Group findings are presented to the class with a view to consolidate and summarize the information. Each week these provide students with verbal feedback from their tutors, to gauge their progress and gain ideas for future direction. Face-to-face teaching in lectures/tutorials and students access of UTSOnline to view videos, reference materials, and communication tools help them to prepare and develop their individual and group work assessment tasks. Verbal feedback is integral to each tutorial collaborative activity. Tutor feedback during tutorials will support students to draft a report, and written feedback on the final report is also provided. All tutorial sessions and lectures are designed to help students to prepare for the final exam. The teaching and learning strategies in this subject support the UTS model of learning: 1) An integrated exposure to professional practice through dynamic and multifaceted modes of practice-oriented education; 2) Professional practice situated in a global workplace, with international mobility and international and cultural engagement as centrepiece; 3) Learning which is research-inspired and integrated, providing academic rigour with cutting edge technology to equip graduates for life-long learning. Real world problems and case studies will be discussed and students need to provide critical and relevant solutions. These approaches aim at preparing students to become more autonomous, involved and responsible for their own learning.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject primarily covers the following topics:  Business strategy frameworks and IS strategy models The strategic use of Information resources Delivering business value through IT strategy IS for enabling and managing business processes IS and the design of work Governance of the IS organization IS sourcing Managing IT projects Knowledge management, business intelligence, and analytics as source of strategic advantage</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">IT Strategy https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/IT_Strategy_(Information_Technology_Strategy) Business IT Alignment https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Business_IT_Alignment IT4IT&trade;, Version 2.1, an Open Group Standard https://pubs.opengroup.org/it4it/refarch21</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">31269</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer Science</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject introduces information system concepts and describes how these concepts can be used to model business requirements. It outlines how the ability to capture information about the system in ways understood by its eventual users improves the final quality of the system. An overview of agile and non-agile software engineering principles, methods, tools and techniques is presented and practised in small teams. The subject introduces various analysis approaches found in contemporary system development including object-oriented methods, agile methods, business process modelling and entity-relationship modelling. It explores the relationships between these techniques and their application, and how they are used to capture and model the business requirements. Students apply various requirements elicitation, analysis, modelling and specification techniques to case studies in small teams.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject uses a combination of formal seminars and collaborative and active learning workshops to support a practice focussed learning strategy. This subject is based on a practical case study and provides regular feedback. The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work based on case studies. In seminars, topics from the recommended texts are covered and additional material from other sources are introduced where necessary. After introducing the concept and topic in the seminar, these topics will be practiced via interactive and collaborative exercises. Workshop sessions are used to support the seminars with illustrative examples, practice exercises and case studies that further reinforce the material originally presented in seminars. Workshops are also an extra opportunity for students to ask questions and generate a discussion based on UTSOnline material. Workshop sessions involve a range of activities such as role playing, think-pair-share, attempting short quizzes each week, short presentations, working in groups, group discussion, critiquing other students work, problem solving exercises, analysing stakeholder needs, etc. In workshops, students will apply the material and build a working relationship with other team members in a collaborative group learning environment. The collaborative and active learning environment will require students to work with other students in small groups on workshop and assignment case study exercises. As pre-work, each week students will need to read and understand the material and then prepare the models and diagrams and bring it to the seminar and workshop for feedback. For assignment case study, students are required to do some pre-work and bring the work in progress (draft models) to the seminar and workshop sessions. Regular feedback will be provided to students each week in the seminar and workshop. Most weeks, tutors will provide feedback on the work students have done for the workshop and assignment case studies. This will enable the students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission of assignments, and consequently improve their learning and performance in the subject. For weekly assessable quizzes, each week immediate feedback will be provided straight after students have attempted the assessable weekly quizzes. Quizzes will be marked each week and marks will be uploaded to UTSOnline so that students can track their progress and performance in the subject regularly and before the census date. Please note students are expected to put in some additional study time outside of class time. The University regards a 6 credit point subject as requiring 9-12 hours of study per week, including class time. Students must read the recommended and reference books outside of class time so that they can effectively participate in group work and discussions that are integral to the understanding of the topics.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">1.

The challenge is to develop systems that enable stakeholders to collaboratively develop creative solutions to address such needs. Students work in teams to use tools that encourage the creativity needed to provide innovative solutions and learn how to combine these tools into development processes. The emphasis is on tools now used in design thinking and ways they are used in development, such as the double diamond method or the Stanford Hasso-Plattner processes. Examples of tools include persona maps, journey maps and the development of themes that can be used to formulate joint value propositions that satisfy stakeholders from a number of perspectives especially business activity, process workflow, social networking and knowledge sharing, and user-design perspectives. The subject then describes choosing appropriate emerging technologies to realise the solutions.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In Business Systems Design students will analyze the complexities in business and social settings, define problems using case studies and to deliver proposals for solutions. Classes are organised as a collaborative environment in which students work in teams to identify issues that need to be addressed to develop integrated business goals. Students access UTSOnline to engage in material, information and guidelines that assist them in using specialised design thinking tools in class. These tools stimulate communications in class that are commonly found in the business environment. Verbal feedback is integral to the collaborative team and is provided to students each week to inform and evaluate their current progress. This in turn feeds into preparation for the following week where feedback is ongoing. Additional feedback is given by evaluating reports through presentations where students can use the feedback to further add value to the reports. Quizzes inform the application of knowledge of the concepts learnt in the subject and using feedback, students have the opportunity to increase clarity of communication in their presentation and report.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Complex environments and problems in such environments.

Students embark on theoretical and computer-aided design of circuits, and construct and experimentally verify circuit behaviour using appropriate laboratory equipment. On entry to this subject, students are assumed to have knowledge of basic devices, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and operational amplifiers, as well as basic circuit analysis skills, such as mesh and nodal analysis, Thevenin&#39;s and Norton&#39;s theorems, source transformation and superposition. Using this understanding as a starting point, the subject introduces the basic theoretical models that underpin signals and system analysis. Topics covered include: sinusoidal steady-state analysis using phasor transformation; derivation of ordinary differential equations to model circuits and solution of those equations using Laplace transformation; power in single and three-phase AC circuits; transfer (network) functions, poles and zeros, s-plane analysis and Bode plots; first- and second-order systems; time and frequency domain solutions; response to step, impulse and periodic inputs; response to an arbitrary input using convolution; frequency selective circuits; Fourier series; and two-port circuits. Students use analytic modelling, aided by circuit simulation and symbolic software such as MATLAB, to investigate and design real-world circuits. Comparison of experimental results and model predictions is emphasised in the laboratory sessions.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campusSpring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Class time is used for tutorials and laboratories. Student learning is enhanced by attendance at and participation in all scheduled classes. In addition to this, an average student is expected to spend at least 5 hours per week in activities that will support their learning. This may include watching lecture videos, reading the textbook and lecture notes, attempting the &ldquo;Recommended Problems&rdquo; provided in UTSOnline for each chapter, and preparation for laboratory sessions and assessment items. Lecture videos (weekly details in Program) This subject provides narrated videos of lectures, accessed via UTSOnline, along with lecture &ldquo;slides&rdquo; as a pdf. The pdf may include slight changes to the video. You must the watch the video prior to each tutorial, noting any things you don&rsquo;t understand. You should also read the linked chapter from the textbook. Tutorials (weekly details in Program) Each student is expected to attend their scheduled tutorial class each week. Some tutorials will start with a quiz. Tutorials are an opportunity for you to ask questions about the content presented in the lecture videos and to apply the content to the recommended problems for each chapter. A typical tutorial activity will be for students to form small groups, be given different problems to solve, and report their solutions to the class. Your tutor may work through some selected problems to provide a model for the type of thinking you would need to do to solve the exercises. Although some worked solutions are provided, you will learn very little if you do not attempt the problems before referring to the solutions. The university timetable system will allocate each student to a tutorial and lab group prior to the session commencement. If you wish to change to another group, you should apply to do so through myTimetable, but you may also request a change for a particular week via email to the Subject Coordinator. Laboratories (weekly details in Program) Laboratories are an important part of the learning experience in this subject. Your understanding of the theoretical concepts of the subject will be strengthened when you find that your lab results obey those theories. Before coming to each lab, you must read the laboratory notes and complete (or make a genuine attempt at) the given preparatory work. For most labs, the preparatory work includes determining component values to achieve a specification, and you will not be able to undertake the experiment without having completed the design beforehand. For Labs 1-6 there is an assignment, which assesses knowledge associated with the lab work, to be completed and submitted before the specified deadline after the lab, as a team of two for Labs 1, 2 and 6 and individually (though you will share measurements with your lab partners) for Labs 3, 4 and 5. For Labs 1-6, unless Special Consideration is granted (e.g. due to illness), a student must attend the lab and contribute to experiments to be eligible to submit that lab assignment to gain its assessment mark. For Labs 1, 2, 5 and 6, you and your team partner can attend the scheduled lab session in the Subject timetable and initial the attendance sheet or you can attend any open lab time convenient to you both providing you take a selfie photograph of both team members together in the lab with the circuit. It is recommended that you attend the scheduled lab time as it will have a lab demonstrator present to help you, which will not be the case for the open lab times. For Labs 3 and 4, which involve voltages that could pose a safety hazard, you must attend the scheduled lab and it is essential that you enter at the start time of the lab as you must attend the safety briefing given at the start of the lab. If you are between 5 and 20 minutes late, you will have to attend a second briefing and may not finish the lab. If you are more than 20 minutes late, you will be refused entry to the lab. If you are unable to attend a lab session due to some extenuating or special circumstance, you should email the Subject Coordinator, ideally before the lab, as it may be possible to make alternative arrangements for you. However, if alternative arrangements are not possible, you must apply for Special Consideration through https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/managing-your-course/classes-and-assessment/special-circumstances/special, which requires you to obtain a completed UTS Professional Practitioner Certificate. Attendance for any particular lab is not compulsory for the subject but it is compulsory to attain assessment marks for that lab assignment and as stated under &ldquo;Missed a compulsory class or participation requirement&rdquo; within the above website, you must apply within 5 working days of the lab in order to seek an adjustment to your total lab assessment mark (e.g. by scaling of your other lab marks). Before attending any of Labs 1, 2, 5, or 6, you must have read the safety documents provided on UTSOnline relating to Category A labs, and before attending either of Labs 3 or 4, you must have read the safety documents relating to Category B labs. In laboratory sessions, you will work in small groups. The checking of the circuit by a member of group is an important step to identify faults or potential hazards before activating the circuit; additional checking by a lab demonstrator is obligatory for Labs 3 and 4. Lab demonstrators will encourage students to develop appropriate safe working practices while in Engineering laboratories. This is in accordance with the Environment Health &amp; Safety (EHS) requirements for conduct in all UTS laboratories (in-line with NSW Occupational Health and Safety legislation). Further, staff will enforce EHS requirements where necessary, and this includes the exclusion of students who are not wearing appropriate, enclosed footwear. Design Project To test your ability to coalesce your learning through the Subject and apply it to design a circuit to meet a product specification, without being told what circuit or components to use, you will be given a Design Project to be completed in teams of 4 (ideally, but with allowance for 2 or 3 students, depending on the total number of students in a Group). Over the last few weeks of the Session, you will design your circuit, purchase components yourself, test the circuit in the lab and write a report describing the design and test results. Learning Strategy in Circuit Analysis What matters most in this subject is what you do, not what the teaching team does. Learning in this subject is best achieved by you working through exercises of different types and, in the case of laboratory prework, seeing your answers confirmed in the laboratory. Like playing a sport or learning a language, it is the practise that develops skill. You have already had exposure to some content of this subject in the subjects &ldquo;Introduction to Electrical and Electronic Engineering&rdquo; and &ldquo;Electronics and Circuits&rdquo;. This subject is intended to raise your skill level on those topics from a basic understanding to advanced competence. If you need additional help than the tutorials, send your tutor an email requesting an appointment. Try hard yourself first to understand a concept or solve a problem, as you&#39;ll learn most, but if you get stuck, seek help! Using symbolic software, such as Matlab, will enhance your problem-solving productivity. Such software allows you to easily invert matrices and find roots of polynomials as well as graph solutions so you can verify that they are consistent with your expectations and the basic circuit laws. Most of you will already be aware of the importance of group work and group learning in the practice of engineering. Be supportive of this process and you are far more likely to succeed. In this subject, you will undertake the laboratories as a group, and in tutorials, you can work together on the tutorial problems. Provide assistance to each other along the way and learn from the difficulties or strengths of the others. Learning in this way can lead to both social and academic rewards. The ability of a group to achieve its goals depends very much on the dynamics of the group, the willingness of each member to take appropriate responsibilities and roles, planning and reflective practice. There is no single recipe for success. Here are a few factors that may help:  positive interdependence: a sense of working together for a common goal and caring about each other&rsquo;s learning; individual accountability: every team member carries their load; abundant verbal, face-to-face interaction: learners explain, argue, elaborate and link material and learning experiences; sufficient social skills, including appropriate leadership, communication, trust and conflict resolution skills; team reflection: the team periodically assesses how they are working together and how they can improve things.  Clearly, learning in a group is desirable. However, your practical circumstances may make this process difficult. In this case, explore the use of the online support we provide on UTSOnline to help you.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Competency in the following topics is expected by the end of the course:  time and frequency response of electric circuits AC steady-state circuit analysis, i.e. steady-state sinusoidal analysis single-phase and polyphase systems three-phase star-star and star-delta systems unbalanced four-wire and three-wire systems power computation and measurement in three-phase systems the use of graphical techniques such as phasors in AC analysis the response of systems to stored energy response of systems to sudden change (e.g. closing or opening of switches) circuits with controlled sources response of circuits to switched stimuli, including sinusoids use of transformations to simplify determination of circuit responses to input voltages Laplace transforms as a means of generalising DC and AC circuit analysis techniques signals and their properties (e.g. average, RMS, piece-wise time description, singularity functions) application of transfer (network) functions characterisation and modeling of systems via their response to impulses and sinusoids the application of s-plane techniques, poles and zeros graphical techniques for predicting the shape of the frequency response (Bode plots) the convolution integral as a means of determining the system response (analytical and graphical) systems with energy coupling (e.g. transformers) relating frequency and time response of a system frequency response of first and second-order filters, including analysis and construction determination of the Fourier series for a periodic function inferring the response of a linear circuit to a periodic input analysis of two-port circuits</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Required Textbook James W.

This textbook is available for purchase from Pearson Australia (or via http://www.pearson.com.au/) or other online suppliers (including some who sell through ebay). It is essential that you have access to (ideally your own copy of) this text, for both its exposition of the theory but also its problems which we will work on throughout the subject. Any of the 9th, 10th or 11th editions may be used, with the order of preference being the 10th (most preferred), the 9th, then the 11th (least preferred). The end of chapter problems differ between the additions, but usually just by changing the parameter values. The text and the Assessment Problems throughout the text are almost identical. Alternative equivalent recommended problems will be given for the 9th edition and 11th edition where one exists. However, any worked solutions in class will use the 10th edition problems, as will our references to page numbers. Previous Edition: Note: the older textbook US Edition ISBN-13:978-0-13-6114994 differs in a lot of the problems and is not recommended. As an optional supplement to the textbook, Pearson have a MasteringEngineering site which includes guides and, at least for an earlier US edition of the textbook, about five video solutions of Assessment Problems per textbook Chapter. Though they are from the US edition they appear to mostly be the same as for our International Edition. It is up to you whether you think this site access is worth purchasing, bearing in mind that many of these Assessment Problems will also be covered in our Lectures, Tutorials and in UTSOnline. This site access can be combined with the textbook paperback purchase and access to an eBook. Or you can buy the eBook on its own.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41891</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Complementing the existing cloud computing subjects, this subject introduces the concepts and implementation of cloud computing infrastructure.

Besides formal lectures, students are required to watch the online introduction videos and pre-study some topics, e.g. what is the cloud, what is cloud computing, and what is cloud computing infrastructure, in week 0. Then, to start the week 1 lecture, questions related to the week 0 topics will be asked and discussed. Moreover, students are required to pre-read the online materials before the week 5 lecture. In the week 5 lecture, students will collaborate in groups to discuss, present and critique topics on the challenges in building an IaaS platform. The tutorials are combined with laboratories and will provide opportunities for students to link the theory which has been taught with practice. Students will need to finish the lab exercises every week, following the instructions given in lab documents. Students will need to collaborate in groups to develop solutions for some major lab tasks, especially when the major assignment is released. Students are required to have face-to-face discussions with their tutors every week to receive feedback for lab excercises 1-7. During these sessions, feedback, including suggestions on how to answer incomplete solutions, implementations and configerations of cloud platforms, will be duscussed to help students fill in any gaps in the knowledge required for this subject. The major assignments will encourage students to extend their study to outside of the formally taught subject content. Students will receive feedback on assignment 1 in week 7 during the tutorial/lab sessions. The feedback will be useful when preparing for the written exam. After Assignment 2 is released in week 6, students are required to discuss a learning contract with their tutor/s before they start the design and implementation.

Due to these offerings, government agencies, organisations and industries are increasingly moving towards cloud-based enterprise IT solutions. In order to understand the impacts of adaptation of cloud-based solutions in businesses from cyber security perspectives, students must understand and learn the fundamentals of security, privacy and trust in cloud systems, and be able to apply them in practice. In this subject students learn how to develop trustworthy applications through project-based learning. They implement a secure cloud application using one of the available cloud services (eg AWS).

Generally, topics covered during a week become pre-work for the following workshop sessions. During the workshop, face-to-face topic presentations, individual and group activities will take place. The key theme running the class is project work. As part of project, students will be required to consider selected real and hypothetical case-based scenarios, which they can extend and add colour and value to. The students will ease into the class using an individual task, which is based on immersion and literature search. While this would remain at the genericl level, the idea is this task would dovetail into the project that would follow the individual task. During the subject of the session, several students will be randomly selected to answer those questions in the class. Some of the tasks from the assessment items will need to be submitted periodically, and thre is a need get feedback from peers.

It is not as simple as just having an idea or jumping straight into coding or creating visual assets without a plan. A high-quality game design must be well structured and documented, carefully crafted for a specific target audience, communicated and negotiated with a team of other designers, scoped to be implementable by a given team of developers within time constraints, and evaluated and iterated on many times until a finely tuned game experience emerges. A professional game designer is an engineer of entertainment. Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them. Students will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group&#39;s shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback. By the end of the session, students will have both a board game and digital game that are novel and refined, which can be used in future employment portfolios to highlight interaction design skills in entertainment domains.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject provides active learning opportunities in a collaborative environment. It focuses on the practical application of game design theories to build commercial-ready games. Students are expected to produce a physical board game and a digital game at the end of this subject. The top performing groups of the session are typically invited to the Autumn Student Games Showcase. Each year, this event sees more than two hundred students, staff, industry partners, research collaborators, and family members come to UTS to view games projects from around the faculty and judge the winners for the best games of the night. In each week, students are expected to have completed any videos or reading material provided on UTSOnline before the lecture, in which these concepts will be discussed in more detail. The lectures will involve new content presented from the instructor, as well as group activities around the pre-lecture material. In the weekly two-hour labs, students will normally complete group activities that build towards their board and digital games. These activities will guide students through the designing, documenting, and playtesting processes by utilizing theory and practices presented in the lecture. Students are expected to attend these labs every week to effectively contribute to their group. If a group member cannot attend on a given week, they should be in contact with the group through other means to coordinate the next week&#39;s activities. Groups will conduct playtests on their designs each week during the lab time, starting from Week 2. This allows for multiple weeks of formative feedback from other students and teaching staff to enhance their designs before the final submissions of the board game and digital game assessments.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Major topics covered in this subject are:

This subject aims to give students a balance of theory and practice, both of which are important to the understanding of and efficient development with computer graphics technology. Students learn fundamental principles of graphical pipelines and representations and put them into practice in the modern context of WebGL via the ThreeJS framework. By completing this subject, students gain valuable knowledge of the underlying graphical systems of game engines and 3D animation software, as well as skill in creating interactive 3D web applications that can be applied to a broad range of future studies and careers.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject will offer one 2-hour face-to-face interactive workshop each week and one 1.5-hour lab each week. During the workshop, students will get a blend of traditional lecture presentations on the theory of computer graphics as well as some live programming session in the ThreeJS framework to demonstrate the theory being put into practice. Students are encouraged to bring their laptops (if they are available) and follow along with the live programming sessions in order to deepen their own understanding of the content. Students are also encouraged to actively participate during the workshop by raising questions, discussing concepts with peers, and experimenting with the provided code. During the labs, students will implement components of their project by using the implementation details shown during the lecture.

The theoretical basis of computer-aided design is developed so that students are aware of the underlying capabilities and limitations of the approach. Mechanical system simulation software is used for designing mechanical systems and controls, and to introduce virtual prototyping. A finite element analysis program is used for analysing stresses in mechanical components and systems. Although commercially available software is used, students are not simply trained in the use of that particular program. Rather, the software serves as a vehicle to illustrate the general approach to computer-aided mechanical engineering and the importance of having clear concepts and sound knowledge of the fundamental underlying principles.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The teaching and learning approaches consist of a mix of lectures, guest lectures, tutorials and computer-based laboratories. There is an emphasis on developing self-study capability. Detailed topic notes and associated reading materials, including computer laboratory instructions and educational research papers, are made available on UTSOnline so that students can prepare for their face-to-face activity. In each topic, students will be given the key concepts and theory of computational solid mechanics and design optimization, as well as basic steps and procedures in how to apply main-stream software tools to find solutions for typical mechanical design problems that are practice-based. Since the subject is designed for advanced topics in numerical methods and design optimization, research articles are also integrated into the subject material to broaden the vision and abilities of students for the benefit of their future career development. Several assessment items are designed specifically to help students consolidate their learning and to provide timely and formative feedback throughout the session. A group project is used to facilitate collaborative teamwork during face-to-face classes. Students are encouraged to form their own groups and propose their own design problem with a particular focus on those with practical industry application. Groups are organised with up to 6 members and a team leader is nominated to manage discussions and team roles. Each group is required to produce a detailed project report which follows the style of a technical research report. Feedback is provided electronically regarding project proposals early in the teaching session. Academic staff are available during class to respond to group queries, and to review and approve the scope of a proposed project topic. In addition, academic staff guide groups in developing the correct skills and problem solving techniques in the laboratory activities. The integration of key concepts and the practical application of mechanical design is encouraged through this feedback process. The overall criteria to guide the group project is that the finite element method and design optimization technologies (both theory and software) have to be reasonably involved and applied in the project. References to research articles which are closely related to the major topics of the subject are also recommended, where relevant. Two guest lectures from industry are given, which showcase some of the more practice-based mechanical design applications from industry. The aim is to further solidify the connections between knowledge in class and practice in engineering applications.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer-aided design and modelling for solid geometry Computational mechanics Numeical simulation and Finite Element Method Design of mechanical structural components and systems Optimization criteria and sensitivity analysis Topologial design optimization</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41078</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C09119 Bachelor of Computing Science (Honours)</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer Science</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer scientists grapple with difficult computational problems, from fast and efficient compression algorithms to finding the fastest route home in the evening.

This subject builds on the knowledge of statics, solid mechanics and structural analysis of indeterminate structures that the students have learnt in the previous structural strand subjects.
Students learn about the behaviour and design of RC beams, slabs and columns and PSC beams, for both serviceability and strength.

Concrete is the most common construction material used in the world. It can meet a diverse array of prescriptive and performance-based requirements. The constituent raw materials of concrete and its production methodology, and the placement and curing methods used, all contribute to determining the compliance of the concrete to performance-based requirements, standard testing methods and specification. Innovative concrete mixes and testing methods are continuously being developed to increase the use of concrete as an advanced construction material that can meet the demand of the highest performance requirements. This subject provides students with an in-depth understanding and knowledge of a variety of topics relating to concrete. It provides practical examples and practical learning experiences, which allow students to understand concrete technology at an advanced level.

The construction of concrete structures requires a thorough understanding of the functional role of the raw material components that are selected, the production methods utilised, and the supply, transportation, placement and finishing of concrete at a construction site. It is also necessary to have an understanding of the fresh and hardened concrete properties, application, specification, prescriptive and performance-based requirements of concrete. In order to develop, design and build safe, economical, environmentally friendly and durable structures, a thorough knowledge of the production, properties and testing of all types of concrete and accompanying practices is vital.

Much of the value and strength of the subject relates to the development of an understanding that a leadership role in engineering construction projects requires a holistic approach that blends technical skill, logical reasoning, judgement and managing activities and people. The construction industry requires all of these aspects to be constantly applied to a myriad of issues both large and small.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">An important part of the subject design is aimed at providing opportunity for students to develop their reasoning skills as well as their independent learning capacity. Student learning in the subject is facilitated by a combination of: 1. Contact meetings that incorporate blended lectures that aim at providing supplementary explanation and broader real-life context to the information and theoretical concepts contained in the study guides. Some synthesis is attempted to demonstrate connections between various ideas and aspects of knowledge. A degree of practicality is introduced through anecdotes, which assists the student make connections to an industry framework. Many of the activities promote the benefit of establishing a small out of class study group that meets regularly. 2. Completion of 8 online quizzes that provide continuous formative assessment. The tests are designed to assist students to understand many of the subtleties of the subject content. Computer provided feedback is available on completion of each test. The tests allow students to immediately become aware of their strengths and weaknesses and to address knowledge and/or understanding deficiencies. Students may retake the tests multiple times and at any stage of the session.  3. Assignments that reinforce aspects of knowledge and theory set out in the subject resources but are primarily designed and structured to allow students to reflect on real life application and to develop practical skills. The &ldquo;Notebook assignment&rdquo; (Assessment item 1) aims at encouraging self-directed study of practical construction activity. Throughout the teaching session the student must choose a number of sites where construction or building activities are being undertaken and critically observe and report on these activities. The &ldquo;Team Planning Assignment&rdquo; (Assessment item 2) requires the student to participate in a group assignment and contribute to building and maintaining a team. The team must complete the initial development of a project plan for the construction of an engineering artefact from a set of engineering drawings. The learning is as much associated with people management, as it is with the engineering content of the assignment.  4.Study for the final examination.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject contains two modules; Module 1 Equipment, Technology and Process.

In class, students will group together and peer assess exemplar design reports that are based on real world engineering problems/scenarios. Students are expected to review and grade these reports, reflect on their own evaluations and exchange feedback with other students and teaching staff. This will aid setting the expected performance required for the design reports submitted for assessment. Students are then expected to apply learnt content, problem solving and research skills to write up their own design reports based on a different problem/scenario. After the return of marked design reports, the same peer assessment activity as above will be repeated to provide students with further feedback. The final examination will also incorporate a problem/scenario question where students will be expected to demonstrate their knowledge of learnt subject content and problem solving to solve for the correct answers. Out of class, students are expected to engage in self-paced learning activities such as online quizzes that cover questions on subject content. A discussion board forum is also available online for students to post questions and fellow students and teaching staff to solve and answer. Pre-workshop preparation activities include completing online quizzes before attending the lecture/tutorial workshops. In the lecture/tutorial workshops, students are expected to group together and solve the answers to the questions asked in the online quizzes by sharing their evaluations with other students and teaching staff. At the completion of the workshops, students can re-attempt the online quizzes to practice questions solved in class. Out of class, students can also consult and collaborate with each other to confirm the solutions to the quiz questions.

The studio sessions are designed as building blocks of learning during which time tutors provide weekly feedback about progress, intended activities and achievements to date. Formal assessment of the project outcomes and deliverables occurs at mid and end of session. Early session team formation and skill development activities provide opportunities for feedback about essential team and technical skills.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Modelling and simulation of multivariable systems Linearisation of multivariable nonlinear systems System model identification of multivariable systems State-variable feedback controller and observers Multivariable nonlinear stability analysis in the Lyapunov sense Optimal control and filtering of multivariable systems Robust control of multivariable systems Nonlinear control</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Goodwin, Graebe, &amp; Salgado, &ldquo;Control System Design,&rdquo; Prentice Hall, 2001 Franklin, G.

Topic notes and videos are used to introduce students to the key fundamental concepts and their interrelations. Face-to-face class time is divided into two parts: there is a 1.5-hour interactive seminar-style activity followed by a 1.5-hour tutorial-style activity per week. Students are expected to read the topic notes and watch the UTSOnline videos before coming to the classes. The seminar portion of class time will discuss the major issues and questions raised from the students regarding control system analysis and design. The tutorial portion of class time will involve students forming small groups to work on appropriate tutorial-style problems which help to motivate, illustrate and exemplify the concepts presented in the topic notes and video lectures. Academic staff will facilitate group and whole-of-class discussions on selected problems, with the aim of illustrating techniques and providing immediate feedback on problem-solving processes. Some class time also occurs in computer labs where students are introduced to MATLAB&reg; and Simulink software tools which are used in industry. A group project is undertaken by students so that they apply the learned control methodologies to a practical application. Each group submits a technical report and makes an oral presentation on their control system, to give students practice in communicating technical ideas. Written and verbal feedback, including low stakes assessment, is provided to students to gauge their learning progress throughout the session. The face-to-face time is used to provide immediate verbal feedback, whilst written feedback is provided on written assessment tasks. Students also receive verbal feedback from their peers whilst undertaking the group project.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42024</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">For further details, contact UTS: Engineering.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is available in Shanghai to offshore students only.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42024</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">For further details, contact UTS: Engineering.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is available in Shanghai to offshore students only.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41900</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Security is a major issue for enterprises, with breaches leaving them vulnerable to legal sanctions, financial loss or reduced customer confidence.

A weekly one hour lecture   A two hour of lab This will be a chance for students to form project groups and learn some basic programming skills. Groups are expected to work together for the whole two hour lab session every week and obtain project guidance from the tutor.   Self-organised group meetings Groups should meet up for at least two hours per week in addition to the two hour class time to collaborate on the project and coordinate efforts on the project.   It is the responsibility of the student to check UTSOnline regularly and dedicate time to learning and development outside of class. Lectures and lab sessions are compulsory. They are supported by a series of slides, practical exercises, and additional readings. All materials and additional readings are examinable, unless explicitly stipulated otherwise during the lecture. Programming: If students are not familiar with programming, they will be provided with the opportunity and tools to learn during the beginning of the subject. Students are then expected to apply this skill by modifying an existing computer program. The ability to write code is essential for completion of the project, but not necessary for the final examination. Active Learning: The primary project for this subject involves group programming. Students must prepare for tutorials/labs to work effectively as part of a group, completing administrative, project management, and programming tasks prior to attending face-to-face sessions. Groups are expected to meet both inside and outside of class time to understand the basic workings of peer-to-peer communication by examination of example code. Groups must then improve the security of communication by implementing secure protocols. Basic project and group management skills will be essential for effective collaboration. Students will be asked individually to provide feedback on the code modifications made by other groups online.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">William Stalling, Cryptography and Network Security, 7th Edition, Pearson, 2017</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42036</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Mobile devices with their hugely increased usage of various applications and services have attracted a plethora of possible attacks.

Intelligent robots are real-time distributed systems that must make complex real-time decisions autonomously using data collected from a wide range of sources such as sensors and the internet. To deal with this complexity, professionals must not only make sense of complexity, context and social norms in real-world scenarios, but translate such insights to algorithms suitable for autonomous use by a robot. In this subject, students work in groups to implement intelligent robot behaviours to solve a challenging real-world problem. Through this exercise, students develop their expertise in data analytics and machine learning. They develop an appreciation for the complexity, technical challenges and ethical issues associated with developing real-time data-driven intelligent systems. They gain an ability to recognise and select state-of-the-art algorithms, methodologies, techniques, experimental tools and evaluation methods.

The subject provides three hours in-class activities in each week.  Students will combine theory and practice to explore the challenges of building intelligent robots that (1) are aware of the real users&rsquo; needs and interactions, (2) consider legislative, ethical and social implications, and (3) integrate available state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.  We build this subject upon the following three interrelated learning activities:   Understand Theory. Students will conduct independent study and actively participate in collaborative discussions around selected readings. They will find novel connections between topics for the design of socially acceptable, ethical, effective and efficient data-driven robotics applications. They will be engaged in in-depth conversations during class.  Conduct Research. Students will formulate research hypotheses, identify a sound methodology to test the hypotheses and run trials. They will engage in the practice of research through supervised in-class activities, as well as through independent research conducted beyond the classroom.  Apply Theory and Research. Students will be supported through coaching in open-ended laboratory sessions in which they apply the acquired theoretical and research skills to produce viable designs and implementations of robotic applications. Students will be assisted in in-class coding exercises, and be expected to develop code outside of class to validate a prototype.    The theoretical aspects are delivered as reports and scientific research papers provided online. This material is to be read prior to class and will be discussed during the class. Students and the teaching team will interact and collaborate to reason about underlying implications of the topics under discussion. Students will be further engaged by formulating research questions about social phenomena related to the discussed topic.  In-class activities will also be used to explore the practical components of intelligent robotics. Students will be allocated to groups of three to five members and will work together to follow a user-centred development methodology that integrates the topics covered by the provided material.  Assessed deliverables are (a) the design of a data-driven and intelligent robot application, (b) a working prototype of the robot application, (c) a written report and seminar.  Students will apply insights gained in the subject to develop a software system for an existing robot platform, to that reveals insights about the intelligent interaction between users and robots. The individual effort of each student will be evaluated by individual contributions to the project code and other deliverables.  Groups of students will work together to prepare a final report and short seminar. The report will include an exploration of concepts relevant to data-driven intelligent robotics and the interaction between such systems and human users. A peer assessment process will be used to assess individual contributions to the project report. The outcomes and finding of the group will be presented in a short seminar to peers. After the presentation, the audience and the teaching team will have the chance to ask students questions. The questions can involve practical aspects of their work or theoretical topics related to the developed application. The answers to the questions will contribute to the final assessment of the presentation, together with the level of clarity of the presentation.  This subject integrates design thinking skills, sound research methodologies and practical coding skills. These features are crucial for the development of future intelligent system professionals.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to tools for intelligent robot applications development;  Robotics sensors, their limitations, format, usage and processing for data-driven applications;  Introduction to user-centred design in the context of intelligent robot applications;  Legislative, ethical and social implications of data-driven robotics applications;  User engagement and people perception in intelligent robot applications;  Technologies and languages for implementing robotics applications;  Methodologies for the formulation of hypotheses relevant to human-robot interaction research and to the design of experiments able to test them.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Weekly required readings will be made available on UTSOnline.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41077</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C09119 Bachelor fo Computing Science (Honours)</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer Science</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Intelligent robots are a disruptive technology poised to transform business and society.

Through this exercise, students develop their expertise in data analytics and machine learning. They develop an appreciation for the complexity, technical challenges and ethical issues associated with developing real-time data-driven intelligent systems. They gain an ability to recognise and select state-of-the-art algorithms, methodologies, techniques, experimental tools and evaluation methods. Students who complete this subject are ready to be productive members and thought-leaders in teams building the next generation of intelligent systems to transform business and society.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In this subject, students work to design and implement a social robot to solve a complex and sophisticated challenge problem inspired by a real-world commercial application or by published research.  The subject provides three hours in-class activities in each week.  Students will combine theory and practice to explore the challenges of building intelligent robots that (1) are aware of the real users&rsquo; needs and interactions, (2) consider legislative, ethical and social implications, and (3) integrate available state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.  We build this subject upon the following three interrelated learning activities:   Understand Theory. Students will conduct independent study and actively participate in collaborative discussions around selected readings. They will find novel connections between topics for the design of socially acceptable, ethical, effective and efficient data-driven robotics applications. They will be engaged in in-depth conversations during class.  Conduct Research. Students will formulate research hypotheses, identify a sound methodology to test the hypotheses and run trials. They will engage in the practice of research through supervised in-class activities, as well as through independent research conducted beyond the classroom.  Apply Theory and Research. Students will be supported through coaching in open-ended laboratory sessions in which they apply the acquired theoretical and research skills to produce viable designs and implementations of robotic applications. Students will be assisted in in-class coding exercises, and be expected to develop code outside of class to validate a prototype.    The theoretical aspects are delivered as reports and scientific research papers provided online. This material is to be read prior to class and will be discussed during the class. Students and the teaching team will interact and collaborate to reason about underlying implications of the topics under discussion. Students will be further engaged by formulating research questions about social phenomena related to the discussed topic.  In-class activities will also be used to explore the practical components of intelligent robotics. Students will be allocated to groups of three to five members and will work together to follow a user-centred development methodology that integrates the topics covered by the provided material.  Assessed deliverables are (a) the design of a data-driven and intelligent robot application, (b) a working prototype of the robot application, (c) a written report and seminar.  Students will apply insights gained in the subject to develop a software system for an existing robot platform, to that reveals insights about the intelligent interaction between users and robots. The individual effort of each student will be evaluated by individual contributions to the project code and other deliverables.  Groups of students will work together to prepare a final report and short seminar. The report will include an exploration of concepts relevant to data-driven intelligent robotics and the interaction between such systems and human users. A peer assessment process will be used to assess individual contributions to the project report. The outcomes and finding of the group will be presented in a short seminar to peers. After the presentation, the audience and the teaching team will have the chance to ask students questions. The questions can involve practical aspects of their work or theoretical topics related to the developed application. The answers to the questions will contribute to the final assessment of the presentation, together with the level of clarity of the presentation.  This subject integrates design thinking skills, sound research methodologies and practical coding skills. These features are crucial for the development of future intelligent system professionals.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to tools for intelligent robot applications development;  Robotics sensors, their limitations, format, usage and processing for data-driven applications;  Introduction to user-centred design in the context of intelligent robot applications;  Legislative, ethical and social implications of data-driven robotics applications;  User engagement and people perception in intelligent robot applications;  Technologies and languages for implementing robotics applications;  Methodologies for the formulation of hypotheses relevant to human-robot interaction research and to the design of experiments able to test them.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Weekly required readings will be made available on UTSOnline.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41083</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C09067 Bahelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice/MAJ03518 Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject focuses on the creation of ideas for new data engineering systems. One way in which data engineering differs from traditional engineering disciplines is the rapid pace at which new ideas emerge, often due to technology developments. This subject encourages students to devise and prototype future applications of data-intensive systems that benefit society. Students take an interdisciplinary approach and explore human-centred design methods for technology such as design thinking approaches.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject runs as a studio. It introduces students to skills in collaborative innovation using the tools and methods of human centred design. The emphasis is on collaborative: research and analysis of contexts, iterative idea generation, testing of ideas, and critical reflection on user experience. The subject aims to develop students understanding of the data engineering design process and to provide them with the skills to design an engineering project from initial concept to the presentation of a solution to a real problem using a human-centred approach. The collaborative classes are designed to support and guide the students through the necessary steps to implement human centred design methods on the project. Students are encouraged to discuss, critique, and learn from each other. Interactivity, as in conversation between teaching staff and students, is important in this subject. Students are highly encouraged to ask and answer questions, be active and proactive, for example by sharing things they have learned. Students will receive feedback from the teaching staff and from their peers about their proposed solutions and their progress. The more interactive each class is, the more the students will learn (especially the ones being interactive) therefore, it is in the students&rsquo; interest to participate in class. There are several cycles of receiving staff and peer feedback built into each session, starting from week 1. Teaching staff are available to stimulate such discussions and provide guidance and formative feedback. Projects are presented to students and each team will choose one problem to engage with through the session. This is achieved through critical inquiry, question asking, rigorous creativity, participatory design, and informed ethics. Throughout the session, student teams design, prototype and test their ideas and in the end create a proposed solution that is presented back at the end of semester in a pitching event. Please note that the project is new and not &ldquo;rolled over&rdquo; from a previous subject or studio. The ability to work in project teams is an important attribute for any engineer &ndash; particularly related to design teams. Students will be required to work in teams in and outside class to apply design thinking and work on the assignments. Students work in teams that mimic professional roles, collaboratively develop and design a solution space for a realworld problem space. The team is responsible for managing their project, ensuring they meet their assignment objectives and deadlines. This subject requires a significant amount of self-directed study and work outside of class hours.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Design, creative and innovative ways to problem solve Approaches for thinking and problem solving in an engineering context Empathy mapping and personas User Experience Product roadmap Project planning and management Team communication and collaboration Reviewing and providing feedback on the work of another team.

Lectures take place in collaborative classrooms and consist of a mix of presentations of the theoretical aspects of Data Visualization and Visual Data Analytics, (see &#39;Content&#39; section of the Subject Outline) along with student led group work whereby small groups discuss real-world applications of the subject content. For example, by using a collaborative classroom, groups can work together on a wide range of options and then present their solutions to their peers for feedback. The lecture classes require substantial preparation from the students. This includes summarizing and discussion of the previous week&#39;s reading: one or more data visualization articles that have been uploaded to UTSOnline in the previous week as students&#39; homework. Usually in the first 10 to 20 minutes of each lecture, students are given a free discussion session to report what they have learned from their homework. The laboratory sessions are conducted in the lab and require substantial preparation from the students. This includes accessing the software and instructions through UTSOnline and familiarising themselves with its use through the practical exercises. Class time will focus on hands-on experience in the use of several popular data visualization tools to complete given tasks that are required for each week&#39;s tutorial quiz as well as the subject assignments. Practical assignments can be performed anywhere, the labs will provide the software necessary to complete these assignments, but you can also complete them on your own devices in your own learning spaces. Online discussion boards are used in UTSOnline for students to ask questions and provide a place for peer support and to receive feedback from tutors.

The code required to implement a database is also covered.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There will be a two-hour lecture and one hour of tutorial. The two-hour lecture slot will not be used entirely for content delivery, it will be used as a question-answer session/workshops/ and for credit and distinction assessments. The one-hour lab will be used for gaining practical knowledge of SQL. However, during the lab time, there will be two assessments conducted which are SQL test1 and SQL test2. Students are given access to the script files. Instructions on how to run script files them via videos posted online. As students follow the instructions they are able to appreciate what the script file does in a limited capacity before attending the lecture. In the lecture, the students are able to find out or appreciate how the script file actually works. Students will also learn to understand the context behind the code that is used to create a database. Understanding the context helps students to better comprehend how it actually solves real-world problems. This higher level understanding allows the student to think laterally and apply various strategies to solve real-world problems using code to create a database. Students collaborate by engaging in consultation with their peers and instructor to interpret design requirement and create entity relationship diagrams. The assessments are designed in such a way that the students receive almost immediate feedback for every assessment item except for the HD assignment. The first two assessments, SQL1 and SQL2 are done during the lab time. As soon as the student gets the correct answer by writing code to access the database the question is marked correct. If the question is marked as correct then the student gets full marks. The credit test questions are given in the subject outline. Students write the credit exam during normal lecture time. The answer should demonstrate that the student understands and is able to apply concepts and demonstrate this with an example of their choice. After the distinction test, the student is given a sheet with the correct answer, so that the student can self-assess as to how well he or she has done in the exam before it is marked. For the HD assignment, students will create a database of their own choosing, which should be a simplified version of a database used in a real-world software system, subject to minimum necessary conditions, such as a minimum number of tables, and a minimum number of relationship types. The feedback for the HD assignment will be given in consultation with the academic three times before the final submission. This allows students to receive an authentic learning experience by engaging with what they tacitly know about a particular field or domain of interest and how their interest in that domain will be applied more laterally by codifying it into a database script so that it solves a problem developing an application which ensures data integrity principles are adhered to. Please note that students are expected to put in significant additional study and practice time of your own in order to develop the practical skills necessary to fulfill the subject learning objectives. Students are expected to use UTSOnline as part of their learning experience for this subject. Software tools to be used in the subject include PostgreSQL, a database management system, and other web-based applications that offer students the opportunity to develop their SQL skills. Learning outcomes: By the end of the subject, a student will be able to model a database using an entity relationship diagram. The student will also be able to understand data integrity issues and best practices in the development of databases. The student will be able to write a script file which will create a database.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to Database Systems

This subject also includes how to interpret an Entity Relationship Diagram. Students learn how to access a database via Structured Query Language (SQL) to retrieve data from the database. The code required to implement a database is also covered in this subject. This subject requires significant preparation before students come to the lectures. Practical exercises are covered during the labs.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There will be a two-hour lecture and one hour of tutorial. The two-hour lecture slot will not be used entirely for content delivery, it will be used as a question-answer session/workshops/ and for credit and distinction assessments. The one-hour lab will be used for gaining practical knowledge of SQL. However, during the lab time, there will be two assessments conducted which are SQL test1 and SQL test2. Students are given access to the script files. Instructions on how to run script files them via videos posted online. As students follow the instructions they are able to appreciate what the script file does in a limited capacity before attending the lecture. In the lecture, the students are able to find out or appreciate how the script file actually works. Students will also learn to understand the context behind the code that is used to create a database. Understanding the context helps students to better comprehend how it actually solves real-world problems. This higher level understanding allows the student to think laterally and apply various strategies to solve real-world problems using code to create a database. Students collaborate by engaging in consultation with their peers and instructor to interpret design requirement and create entity relationship diagrams. The assessments are designed in such a way that the students receive almost immediate feedback for every assessment item except for the HD assignment. The first two assessments, SQL1 and SQL2 are done during the lab time. As soon as the student gets the correct answer by writing code to access the database the question is marked correct. If the question is marked as correct then the student gets full marks. The credit test questions are given in the subject outline. Students write the credit exam during normal lecture time. The answer should demonstrate that the student understands and is able to apply concepts and demonstrate this with an example of their choice. After the distinction test, the student is given a sheet with the correct answer, so that the student can self-assess as to how well he or she has done in the exam before it is marked. For the HD assignment, students will create a database of their own choosing, which should be a simplified version of a database used in a real-world software system, subject to minimum necessary conditions, such as a minimum number of tables, and a minimum number of relationship types. The feedback for the HD assignment will be given in consultation with the academic three times before the final submission. This allows students to receive an authentic learning experience by engaging with what they tacitly know about a particular field or domain of interest and how their interest in that domain will be applied more laterally by codifying it into a database script so that it solves a problem developing an application which ensures data integrity principles are adhered to. Please note that students are expected to put in significant additional study and practice time of your own in order to develop the practical skills necessary to fulfill the subject learning objectives. Students are expected to use UTSOnline as part of their learning experience for this subject. Software tools to be used in the subject include PostgreSQL, a database management system, and other web-based applications that offer students the opportunity to develop their SQL skills. Learning outcomes: By the end of the subject, a student will be able to model a database using an entity relationship diagram. The student will also be able to understand data integrity issues and best practices in the development of databases. The student will be able to write a script file which will create a database.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to database systems

To maintain, or improve, our quality of life it is essential to minimise water pollution problems. With respect to water quality, the development of decentralised water and wastewater treatment systems is becoming more commonplace in unsewered parts of Australia and other countries in the world. Decentralised systems have many advantages compared to centralised systems, for some circumstances. This subject introduces students to the differences in using centralised and decentralised systems and discusses different types of decentralised systems available for water supply and wastewater management for single households or small complexes of units. The subject introduces students to the different technical aspects and allows them to develop skills in the design and principles of these systems. This subject also looks at the overall management of water from water supply to wastewater generation, treatment, and re-use on-site. One aspect of the subject is to look at the different types of systems available in Australia and to understand the water and wastewater technologies that are applied. This subject also covers the current environmental legislation related to decentralised wastewater treatment and disposal. Students who are interested in solving problems in a sustainable manner and who have interests related to town planners, local council officials, small scale system operators, surveyors and architects gain knowledge on decentralised systems.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In this subject student learning is coordinated and facilitated through pre-work and face-to-face sesisons in three block sessions of one and half days each.

We can become excited by the potential of mobile computing, social media, customised and localised apps, and the ways in which they interact with each other. But the real excitement of experience-centred design is in the impulse to use these developments to give people the chance to have a richer life, to include people who might otherwise feel excluded, and to ensure that everybody has a chance to have their say, especially those who often feel voiceless. This subject introduces students to the conceptual ideas behind user experience and experience design, and builds their understanding of the nature of human experience and its mediation by technology. The subject also introduces students to the practical processes of experience design by allowing students to work on a real-world design project with real users, supported with advice and input from practising professionals, and in a context of peer support and feedback. Students can explore approaches that engage users as participants in the design process, with a view to understanding relationships between users and designers in experience-centred design. Working on this project with others allows students the opportunity to engage critically with the theoretical and practical interdisciplinary approaches to information and interaction design.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject includes face-to-face classes and practical activities throughout the semester, constituted by readings, group work and design project development.

These materials help students to proactively manage their study and learning throughout the session. Students are encouraged to discuss and solve the example problems collaboratively. (2) Online learning materials and lectures are designed to cover the fundamental principles and theories followed by student practice to apply the theories to solve practical problems. In solving an example problem, discussions among students and between students and the teaching staff are encouraged. Students are also encouraged to answer questions from other students. Students are encouraged to interact with teaching staff during face-to-face sessions such as lectures and tutorials. (3) Tutorials provide opportunities for students to get assistance and feedback, and facilitates active which includes group discussion on possible ways to solve example practical problems, interaction with students and lecturers to discuss appropriate ways of modelling dynamic systems, designing controller and analysing responses. (4) Interactive lectures will deliver the subject content to students by way of presentations/explanations, group discussion, live demonstrations, and/or student practice to solve problems. (5) Lab demos and lab sessions are designed for students to appreciate real-world dynamic systems and interact with physical test rigs to get hands-on experience. Through these sessions, students will get a better understanding of the behaviour of dynamic systems that are typically encountered in the practice of engineering; and gain an understanding of how such systems can be controlled, or have their dynamics altered, so as to achieve desired outcomes. Lab sessions will be conducted in small groups in a lab/studio environment with each group having 4-5 students. Students need to collaboratively conduct experiments in a team, reflect on what is observed, and participate in discussing the results recorded and any issues encountered during experiments. A lab report is needed from each individual to reflect the learning outcomes. (6) Remotely accessible labs may be used on the session according to availability. These labs provide 24/7 access for students to conduct experiments from anywhere and at anytime, and facilitate e-learning, flexible learning and active learning. Students are encouraged to use these labs to conduct various experiments which may be out of the scope of this subject, to improve their understanding, to inquire into new knowledge, and to discover &#39;new&#39; things that may not be covered in the classes. (7) Students are required to do two projects and one lab report that covers the modelling of one SDOF and one 2DOF system, the design of controllers, experiments with real test rigs, the analysis of simulated and/or experimental results, and discussion and reflection. Although every student needs to submit an individual report for each assessment, they are encouraged to work collaboratively because this helps to impove student learning outcomes. (8) Online quizzes are designed to help students evaluate their learning and identify topics they may find challenging. Immediate feedback is given online, as well as in the form of comments added to graded assessments, and face-to-face in the tutorials after the grading of quizzes. Using this feedback students are encouraged to work together with lecturers to find possible ways to address the challenges. (9) Students are expected to attend lectures and tutorials, actively contribute to discussions and complete the assessment tasks by the due dates.

Using experiential learning methods, classes are supported by online learning materials and communication tools. Selected content will be available online before class. The face-to-face classes engage students in individual and group work, discussions, reflections, and presentations. Students will also work with others across a variety of disciplines to make progress. Students participate in scrums and sprints. Work targets are set, demonstrated, and evaluated in the scrum meetings. The scrums include weekly reviews, scheduled times where the whole group comes together to critique progress and to plan the next week&#39;s sprint as well as times that teams come together to collaborate in the prototyping process. The focus on experiential learning including the scrum meetings and critique processes, mean attendance and engagement is expected for each of the face-to-face facilitated sessions and group collaboration sessions. Individual reflective sessions also make up each week. The teams may also meet outside of class time. Verbal communication and collaboration between students and facilitators are essential parts of any real-world design challenge or project development, and is integral here, particularly during the weekly scrums and sprints. Facilitator(s) and student peers may be present during each scrum to guide progress and to provide constructive feedback on each individual&rsquo;s progress, to inform improved performance towards the next sprint.

Independent Learning UTSOnline Students are required to study UTSOnline material. This includes:  reading the Topic Notes and undertaking the associated problems watching videos that develop key ideas slowly with illustrated examples that emphasise the practical applications of the theory engaging with other Open Educational Resources via hyperlinks  Textbooks Students are required to read the relevant sections of the textbooks and undertake relevant exercises and problems. WebTutor WebTutor is custom-written software that presents students with exercises based on the subject topics. The exercises are unique, as they are randomly generated by WebTutor each time an exercise is viewed. Students are able to practice questions on a topic as many times as they like. This allows students to focus on a particular topic, to pace their learning, and to obtain immediate feedback on their efforts. Online help is available for most exercises from within WebTutor. Students are encouraged to consult the WebTutor questions each week during Tutorial sessions (see the paragraph of Tutorial for detailed arrangements). Open Lab The laboratory is made available to students for out-of-class learning. Students, in groups of two, are encouraged to undertake the laboratories before the timetabled activity. This allows students to:  practice using the laboratory equipment to achieve a basic level of proficiency gain skill in circuit construction, testing, and troubleshooting learn at their own pace so they understand the circuits before being assessed  Timetabled Activities Tutorial There is generally one 2-hour tutorial every week (1 hour for solving tutorial questions, and 1 hour for consulting WebTutor questions). Prior to the tutorial, students attempt the problems posted on UTSOnline for each tutorial session. At the beginning of the tutorial, the tutor will discuss with the entire group the principles underlying the problem set, and any challenges they are facing. Students then work on particular selected problems in groups of around 8-10 students. The tutor is then available to assist each group or individual and will facilitate collaborative discussions amongst the group where needed. The tutorials are meant to be only partially directed by the tutor - most of the time the tutor will be addressing the needs of individual groups and students, but occasionally the tutor may address the whole class if a particular key concept needs to be revised or elaborated on. Fully-worked solutions to a subset of the selected problems are available after the tutorials have been conducted - this allows students to form their own solutions independently of a &#39;model answer&#39;, and then check whether their approach to the solution was correct, or could be improved upon. Laboratory There is generally one 2-hour laboratory every week. The subject places a particular emphasis on the practical, hands-on aspects of electronics and circuits. Students are required to purchase an electronics kit and work in groups of two. Each lab involves the construction and testing of several circuits that are used in real applications. Some of the circuits involve elements of design. The aim is for students to become proficient in moving from theory to practice. The recording, graphing and interpretation of practical results, and how they compare with theory, is also practised. During the lab, students can seek assistance from a lab tutor in relation to the experimental procedure, the expected results, and the use of the equipment. At the end of each lab session, a lab tutor will assess the lab work and provide immediate feedback.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Definitions and Experimental Laws, Op-Amps and Basic Amplifiers, Circuit Analysis Techniques, Linear Op-Amp Applications, Reactive Components, Diodes and Basic Diode Circuits, Source-free RC and RL Circuits, Nonlinear Op-Amp Applications, First-Order Step Response, Op-Amp Imperfections, The Phasor Concept, Circuit Simulation, The Sinusoidal Steady-State Response, Amplifier Models, Frequency Response, First-Order Op-Amp Filters, Second-Order Step Response, Waveform Generation, Second-Order Frequency Response, Second-Order Op-Amp Filters, Complex Frequency, Specialty Amplifiers, Transfer Functions, Sensor Signal Conditioning, System Modelling.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">McLean, P., 48520 Electronics and Circuits Topic Notes, UTS, 2017.

Specific attention will be given to clock generation and distribution. Microcontrollers have a wealth of built-in peripherals. Some of these peripherals will be examined in depth. The encapsulation of microcontroller peripheral functions in software using &ldquo;device drivers&rdquo; will form part of the laboratory program. 4 Memory Modern 32-bit microcontrollers have many types of memory, such as internal Flash, SRAM and external SDRAM; as well as special function registers that are memory-mapped peripherals. Utilising these different memories and registers requires special software techniques in both C and assembly language. 5 Interrupts Interrupts are the key to building real-time embedded systems. The interrupt structure and hardware support for interrupts on a 32-bit microcontroller will be examined. Special compiler support for interrupt service routines will be highlighted. 6 Timing Generation and Measurement The enhanced capture timer module of a 32-bit microcontroller will be examined to see how periodic and aperiodic interrupts are generated as well as how external event capturing can be used to simplify software tasks. 7 Concurrent Software Foreground and background threads will be covered, as well as multithreaded applications and the basis for real-time operating systems. The concept of shared resources and some mechanisms for accessing them using semaphores and critical sections will be discussed. The concept of thread scheduling will be reviewed. 8 Interfacing Standard parallel digital interfacing of external devices such as input switches and keyboards, liquid crystal displays and output LEDs is looked at in terms of hardware and software. A microcontroller often needs to handle analog data, such as an automatic control system, or a measurement system. Methods for obtaining, operating on, and producing analog data at the required rate will be reviewed. Peripherals such as an analog-to-digital converter and a pulse width modulator (PWM) will be looked at in detail. The inter-integrated circuit (I2C) interface will be examined &ndash; it is used to connect to chips such as analog-to-digital converters, accelerometers, Flash memory and many other special purpose chips. 9 Fixed-Point Processing Microcontrollers are limited in their data handling capabilities, as they often need to process data in real-time and most do not possess hardware floating-point capabilities. Finite word length effects will be given and methods to overcome them will be examined. Some numerical methods will be presented for the integer evaluation of difficult results such as the square root. 10 Real-Time Operating Systems An overview of a real-time operating system (RTOS) is given. The process of thread scheduling, pre-emption and thread switching is examined in detail with a simple implementation shown for a priority-based pre-emptive operating system. The design of application software for use in a system with an RTOS is discussed. 11 Design Project This section brings all the other sections together in a project that requires the analysis and design of an embedded system. You will be required to interpret specifications and come up with sound engineering designs using a variety of methods. The designs will be implemented and experimentally verified.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">McLean, P., 48434 Embedded Software Notes, UTS, 2020.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48451</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical Engineering Major and Information and Communication Technology Major of all undergraduate Engineering degrees</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject has two major components: (i) analysis/design, and (ii) implementation, of an advanced computing node.

The tasks involve such activities as reading from key resources, watching a video, completing a quiz, and other online exercises. Responses to the pre-class tasks are used in online tutorial classes to add depth to discussion and are an essential component to the concepts covered throughout the subject. During online tutorials, students will build on the pre-class tasks to learn and apply new skills. These skills will be practiced in class and are designed to be relevant to the tasks involved in the EWB Challenge team project. Areas of learning in tutorial classes include problem solving, team building, exploring scenarios, design and build activities, reflection and group discussion. Activities support acquisition of professional engineering skills in a small group setting under the supervision of a tutor; these skills relate directly to your major team EWB Challenge project. OPELA: An aim of this subject is to help you develop academic and professional language and communication skills in order to succeed at university and in the workplace. To determine your current academic language proficiency, you are required to complete an online language screening task, OPELA. If you receive a Basic grade for OPELA, you must attend additional Language Development Tutorials (each week from weeks 3 to 12) in order to pass the subject. The development of these tutorials is a new university-wide initiative designed to provide personalised support and enhance students&rsquo; English language skills. They will focus on developing your communication skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and your independent learning skills, which will help you to prepare for the subject assessment tasks and for professional workplace communication tasks.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering design process Finding, evaluating and referencing information Academic integrity Professional engineering documentation Effective written, visual and oral communication Teamwork processes and participation Reflective thinking and writing</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48221</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Civil and Environmental Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject provides engineering students with necessary computing knowledge, numerical techniques and programming skills as well as understanding of using knowledge, skills and tools for engineering problem solving.

Through engaging in practice-oriented education and regular reflection, students are provided with the opportunity to discover engineering workplace culture and to develop their basic technical and professional skills. Engineering educators, as well as engineering employers, have long recognised the value of integrating practical experience with academic studies. Each student&#39;s experience is unique. Employer or host organisations are not expected to provide formal training although some may choose to do so. Students are instead required to become active learners and seek opportunities to fulfil the objectives of this experience module. It is expected that students gain this level of experience early in their academic program. The Professional Program is based on two cycles centred around industry-based internships. Each cycle consists of a preparation subject, an internship experience subject and a review subject. This is the internship (middle) subject in the first cycle of the program. This subject involves students observing, practicing and reflecting on their development in basic technical and professional competencies.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus Summer session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Although this is an internship with no formal classes, opportunities exist for students to collaborate and discuss their experiences through an online discussion forum. Through active learning students develop their lifelong learning skills by making regular entries into an online reflective learning journal. Extensive resources and guidance are provided for students through videos, readings and information provided in the subject on UTSOnline. Collaborative learning takes place on the work site between student and workforce. The collaboration they experience here is embedded in the online reflective learning journal entries. A random sample of journal entries are authentically assessed on a regular basis through the internship for structure and relevance according to a rubric and marks awarded accordingly. Formative feedback is provided to students through feedback comments provided in the rubric when a journal entry has been assessed, and through email communication with students. This assists students to improve in their reflective writing and journal keeping. As each student&#39;s internship experience is unique, the subject of fortnightly reflections can vary, however, in general, students should aim to develop some of the Engineers Australia stage 2 competencies.

The aim of the graduate project is to provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate their capacity to bring together their advanced skills and knowledge that have been gained as part of their coursework and apply these to a real-world engineering problem. The depth and extent of the project can vary with credit point requirements. The project may involve the development of a new technology, product and/or process, or the application of existing technologies, products and methods in a new way to solve a problem. In certain cases it may be appropriate to undertake a critical review of a method, ideas, a technology or combinations of these. In all cases it is vital that the project can demonstrate a 'value-added' component that the student has originated. The planning, implementation and documentation of the project are supervised by a member of academic staff from the UTS: Engineering.

It also aims to develop their skills in analysing simple structures such as statically determinate beams and trusses, subjected to various loading and support conditions. On completion of this subject, students should be able to apply static equilibrium conditions as tools to analyse simple structures, and have developed an appreciation of design in civil engineering. The principles developed in this subject form the basis of structural analysis and design. This subject introduces students to the fundamental aspects that are a basis for subsequent fields of dynamics in civil engineering such as fluid mechanics, hydraulics and road design.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus Summer session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Student learning in the subject is facilitated through three face-to-face sessions each week (1 x &#39;lecture&#39; sessions + 1 x tutorial session). Students are expected to be punctual and regular in attending face-to-face sessions in this subject. Students are expected to read the indicated material and answer the associated online questions before the first face-to-face session of the week so that these sessions can focus on problem solving activities in small groups and the problematic material, rather than the parts that most people can understand by themselves. These sessions will consist mainly of problem-solving and discussion. Students are expected to attempt any nominated tutorial questions before their weekly tutorial session. NOTE: As an indication, a typical 6 CP subject would normally assume a total time commitment (including class time) of approximately 150 hours, for an average students aiming to pass the subject). This translates to at least 10 hours per week for this subject. If you are unable to spend that much time on this subject then I suggest you consider withdrawing and re-enrolling when you can spend that much time.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">SI units and physical dimensions used in statics as the basis for structural analysis and design.

Students will be introduced to: 1) the writing of critical incidents, 2) the skills of constructive critical review, and 3) the demands of an online 3-slide presentation. Students are expected to have prepared for this lecture as outlined in the program (see next section of this subject outline). Students should familiarise themselves with the methods of giving and receiving feedback presented in the lecture and detailed in the learning guide. They should also look at the two models for writing reflections outlined in the guide. These models will be described in the lecture and the qualities of a good reflection will be elicited in the tutorials. Before the first face-to-face classes, students submit their reflections to the group journal function in UTSOnline. They then complete the reflection checklist found in the learning materials for the work of other group members. In the tutorial, these checklists will be used as the basis of feedback of each other&rsquo;s work. The discussion will be widened to identify areas of common experience and difference, strengths they discovered during their internship as well as areas requiring work. Through this synthesis of experience, students will begin to articulate their professional identity. Students summarise the feedback they have received from their peers for assessment Task 1. After they have had time to react to the feedback, students will be required to submit their three reflections. This is assessment task 2. The second tutorial is designed for students to work collaboratively to prepare for a 3-slide presentation on their internship. Students should use photos or artefacts from their internship where appropriate. The aim of the presentation is to describe the student&rsquo;s journey.

The success of such a goal is often measured by achieving it on time, what it cost to produce and whether its specifications are met. These goals can also be prerequisites to other larger corporate goals which may also have complex and integral interdependencies together with strict time frames and costs. For engineers to be successful in delivering their parts of projects, an appropriate solution is required (ie agreed quality) as well as delivery (ie on time) to an agreed price (ie to budget). This subject helps students to achieve this. The subject adopts a holistic view of project management, considering issues throughout a project life cycle. It considers the project responsibilities of engineering managers and organisations, from the definition phase of a project to its conclusion. The perspective of stakeholders, particularly the project manager, are considered. The emphasis is interdisciplinary and relevant to all fields of engineering practice. Topics include: modern project management practices; project delivery; definition, timing, costing and planning; managing risk and scheduling resources; teams and inter-organisational relationships; progress and performance; and project measurement and evaluation. This compulsory core engineering subject involves relevant, practice-oriented assessment tasks.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campusSpring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Student learning in this subject is facilitated through a combination of workshops (denoted as lectures in the timetable) which cover active learning (instruction), tutorials (practice), student projects (practice), and student presentations (practice). The subject aims to develop students&#39; understanding of project management and to provide them with the skills to assemble a project team, plan, implement then close a project - on time, to budget. A combination of lectures and tutorials are used to examine each stage of the project management process. Workshops are generally aimed at providing an overview of the subject material and allow for formative feedback, they are run in a modified lecture format. Some theory (from the readings) will be further reinforced, and relevant industry examples given where appropriate. Tutorials are designed to provide a forum for group interactions to further explore and apply the material covered during lectures. The weekly lecture material presented is sourced from designated chapters in the required text. The programme for the lectures is listed in this Subject Outline. Students are expected to have read the appropriate chapters of the required text prior to the lecture so that a workshop atmosphere can be maintained in these lectures to enhance student understanding of this material. The subject also involves a significant group project based on research and interaction with industry to let you show your skills in engineering practice. This project provides students with an opportunity to apply and practice their knowledge. In this assessment task students prepare an authentic industry project plan, with the necessary supporting components, e.g. Scope, WBS, Risk Plan and Communications Plan, etc. Students need to fully engage with this project at a professional level which should then be demonstrated through their submitted authentic Project Plan report and presentation. Students will need to research appropriate industry products available to meet the project&rsquo;s requirements and to liaise with industry for a most suitable solution to take forward. Some time is given in class for students to collaborate on this project. This assessment task also allows students to use their technical skills when developing their project plan from their chosen area of engineering study, i.e. civil, mechanical, mechatronics, electrical and ITC engineering. The ability to work in a project team is an important attribute for any engineer &ndash; particularly when it comes to developing a project plan. Students will be required to work in teams during their tutorials to produce their final report, which is due in Week 11. A presentation by the group of their report will be conducted in Week 11 also. Please note that non-attendance at any workshop or tutorial session is likely to hamper your progress in the subject. Students are expected to attend weekly workshops and tutorials. The tutorials will give students an opportunity to apply the workshop material, help build a working relationship among team members for collaborative learning, and help you prepare for the final exam. Please note that students are not permitted to change their workshop, tutorial session or tutorial / project group once assigned. This subject includes 3 hours per week of face-to-face contact with the subject facilitator and peers. It is considered that to gain a pass on an undergraduate subject in the Faculty of Engineering and IT at UTS, an average student will be required to spend 150 hours per session of study in that subject. It is anticipated you will spend at least a total of 10 hours per week on this subject.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The specific material to be covered includes:  Modern Project Management practices Project Delivery; Definition, Timing, Costing, Planning Managing risk and scheduling resources Project teams Progress and performance Project measurement, evaluation, and closure</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Larson E.W., Honig B., Gray C.F., Dantin U., Baccarini D., 2016, Project Management - The Managerial Process, McGraw - Hill Education, Australia ISBN 9781743071809 (pbk.)

It is carried out in two phases: the preparation and planning phase in this subject, and the implementation phase in 41030 Engineering Capstone. Students undertake the capstone project in their final year of study. In these two subjects students solve complicated engineering problems that respond to industrial, academic and personal interests, taking a systematic approach. The types of capstone projects that students can undertake include research and development, investigation, experimentation, design, building and manufacturing. Students in this subject develop skills in research design, project management and critical communication. This subject, Engineering Research Preparation, emphasises the development of the theoretical framework and the associated project plan for a student&#39;s capstone project. The subject is followed by the implementation phase in 41030. Both subjects aim to strengthen students&#39; knowledge application, and research and communication competencies to the graduate level for engineering practice as per Engineers Australia Stage 1 competencies and faculty graduate attributes. Both subjects also align with Australian Qualifications Framework criteria of graduation concerning knowledge, skills development and application to the bachelor&#39;s (level 7) and honours (level 8) degrees.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Students will read suggested articles within the topics of engineering design theories, research methodologies, and philosophy of engineering before or after watching a series of videos of UTSOnline.

Students learn to integrate and align different enterprise architecture layers to better support the business goals and objectives.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This is a research inspired and practical project-based subject. The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work in small groups. Students are expected to attend the initial subject induction session and weekly workshops. The workshops will give you oppurtunities to apply the teaching material to practical problems and build a working relationship with other students in a collaborative learning environment. In the beginning of teaching session, students are organised into groups, where each group acts as a start-up company. Group size depends on the number of enrollments in the subject. Each teaching and learning week is organised into pre-workshop, workshop and post-workshop activities. Pre-workshop Students are required to do pre-workshop research and reading using material and articles available from UTSOnline, industry and scholarly databases (e.g. Gartner, IEEE, Wiley, AIS eLibrary), watch any relevant videos if available, and do the individual pre-workshop quiz about the upcoming topic before coming into the weekly workshop session. Pre-workshop work is necessary to be able to effectively perform in the upcoming workshop activities. Workshop Weekly face-to-face workshop sessions are facilitated by the teaching staff. Students are expected to attend all the workshop sessions for this subject. Workshop tasks, business problems and industry case studies are posted on UTSOnline before the workshop. Students bring the completed and self-assessed pre-workshop quiz into the workshop session, which is marked by one of the students (peer assessment) and teaching staff in the workshop. Students are also required to do the individual in-workshop quiz, which is based on the previous workshop contents. Students work in small groups on workshop case study project exercises and their own team project. The workshop format enables the students to inquire, discuss and apply the enterprise architecture knowledge to real world business problems and scenarios for deep learning. Students in groups present their work to other groups and teaching staff for feedback during the workshop. Industry experts are regularly invited to workshops, if available, to share their practical experience and insights about the enterprise architecture practices. Students also get an opportunity to present their work to industry experts during their architecture project showcase, which is held in the end of teaching session. This is intended to enhance the employability of students in industry. Students also bring their work-in-progress architecture project artefacts in the workshop sessions to get early and continuous feedback from the teaching staff. This will enable the students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission, and consequently improve their learning and performance in the subject. Post-workshop Students are expected to extend their learning beyond the workshop sessions, by doing additional research and reading outside the weekly workshops. Students need to work on group assignments and revise the contents from the previous workshop for the upcoming in-workshop quiz. Collaborative Architecture Project Hackathon In addition to these face-to-face facilitated workshops, students are required to participate in the &quot;Architecture Project Hackathon&quot; week, in which they work in small groups and develop prototypes for their architecture project. This is intended to enhance their ability to work on their own initiatives and create innovative architecture design solutions.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject covers the following topics:  Architecture Frameworks Architecture Modelling Architecture Vision Business Architecture Information Architecture Social Architecture Application Architecture Platform Architecture Infrastructure Architecture Facility Architecture Opportunities and Solutions Implementation Planning and Governance Change Management</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This is a dynamic and practical subject.

This would be needed for assessment task 1 where students will work in small teams to play the roles of business analysts and learn how to conduct effective interviews with a customer to elicit the requirements for a software product. They will learn how to negotiate and prioritise user needs as well as modelling and analysing the elicited requirements. There will be out of class assessment of their interviewing skills. Students will apply specific technical writing skills to develop a complete set of software requirements specification (SRS). Students will conduct a formal inspection exercise in small teams through role playing and critiquing skills to discover defects in an already developed SRS. Students will also develop reflective skills to identify how they would improve their inspection activities. In this out-of-class assessment task students would have to collaborate together to complete the inspection exercise, which involves students critiquing the SRS and documenting the findings in a rigorous manner. Students are also expected to do research to find specific templates and processes. This is to be completed before the inspection meeting and will be discussed in the class where additional template and processes will be introduced. Feedback for assessment tasks will be given to students two weeks after the due delivery date. Students will also receive continued feedback for their workshops and tutorial exercises on weekly basis. This will be administered by the tutor in the tutorial sessions where the deficiencies in the answers to problems are pointed out to students.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Fundamentals of requirements engineering

Lecture material will be available through UTSOnline. Students are required to read the lecture notes before lectures. Some real world environmental risk design problems are included in the lecture notes and students need to identify the problems and gaps. Classroom teaching will be by powerpoint presentation and whiteboard. Students will be taught how to apply risk assessment principles to address those real world problems, using a range of scientific tools and principles. Regular in-class exercises and workshops are an interactive part of the learning process where environmental risk problems are worked through by students individually as well as in groups. These classes are designed so that students are enabled to learn from each other through discussion and peer and tutor feedback. The subject is taught in Block Mode whereby the students are expected to attend all three (3) blocks of one and a half (1&frac12;) days. There is approximately 5 weeks between blocks. Problem based learning activities are performed in this subject as most case studies and examples are extracted from real world consultancy/research projects. Students are expected to undertake study outside the classroom, which must be at least the equivalent in hours to those spent in the classroom. Students are encouraged to work together for their assignments through group discussion and peer review, but their submitted reports should be completed individually. Feedback will be provided timely, in writing for assessed individual or group work. Verbal feedback will be given for online quiz and in-class exercises, together with peer review.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to environmental risk The process of risk assessment Exposure assessment Dose response and other risk tools Statistics Probability Contaminated site risk assessment Risk analysis and evaluation Risk models Ecological risk assessment Assess and manage risk Standards and processes Risk management Communicating risk</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48350</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Civil and Environmental Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject introduces civil engineering students to essential environmental concepts and the environmental consequences of typical engineering activities.

The subject introduces students to the concepts and techniques involved in facade engineering and their application to the design and procurement of a building facade. The intent of encasing a building structure with a facade is to control the internal environment of the building, providing comfort to the occupants and allowing maximum natural light and ventilation into the building. At the same time, a facade must also be designed to keep out adverse weather elements such as wind and moisture, and comply with energy and ESD requirements. Topics include: the interrelationships between the law, contracts, and fa&ccedil;ade design documents; the various types of fa&ccedil;ade such as masonry, concrete, and glazed curtain walls, and the design principles that underpin their performance; and the assessment of wind loads, and the structural design of glass, aluminium, and structural adhesives, together with their compatibility and durability issues.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lecture mode sessions coupled with some tutorials will be used to explain difficult concepts and foster problem solving skills. Lectures are complemented with slide and video presentation to present state-of-the-art technology in Fa&ccedil;ade systems. As an example in the 3rd or 4th week students are expected to review an online video on the glass manufactring process and in preparation for assessment task 2 discuss the different properties of glass in class with fellow students and the lecturer. A series of assignments are designed to encourage application of concepts to practical scenarios. Students will be required to study prescribed reading material, attempt nominated exercise problems and complete online quizzes prior to attending the lecture according to the weekly teaching schedule. The weekly schedule can be found in the UTSOnline subject website in the folder &ldquo;Subject Information&rdquo;. Important announcements will be issued by email via UTSOnline. Students will also need to check for lecture notes each week. This pre-reading material forms the basis for class discussions. Individual and group assignments, coupled with laboratory demonstration/testing will integrate the acquired knowledge through collaboration with fellow students. Discussion and feedback on the progress of assignment tasks is incorporated in class time. As there are limited textbooks covering the course subjects, students are expected to attend and actively participate in all lecture sessions. Students are also expected to complete assessment tasks by their due dates.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Types of facades; Function of a facade; Facade interface with other engineering disciplines; Industry overview; Approaches to weatherproofing, strengths and weaknesses; Concept of pressure equalisation; Contract basics; Performance versus prescriptive specifications; Role of the drawings; Role of specifications; Program issues; Testing/verification; Warranties; Masonry wall facades (cavity and solid walls); Precast concrete walls; Stone (granite, travertine, marble); Relevant design standards (AS 3700, AS 3600); Overview of window types used (punched, strip); Sealants used to seal joints; Overview of panelised versus stick wall system; Anatomy of a curtain wall; Materials used (glass, aluminium, stainless steel, composite aluminium panels, structural silicone, sheet metal); Basic principles of design; Types of loading (wind, differential building deflections, human impact); Types of fixings; Maintenance of curtain wall facade (building maintenance systems); General issues and common problems; Description of glass (toughened, heat strengthened, annealed); Vision panels (single glazed, doubled glazed, jockey sashes); Glass and energy; An overview of glass design with reference to AS 1288; An overview of aluminium design; An overview of designing composite aluminium panels; Structural silicone design; Prototype testing; Examples of defects; Investigation methodology; Representative inspections; Public risk issues; Legal implications; Guidelines for report writing; Traps for the unwary; Project examples.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The following references are recommended, but optional.

Students gain knowledge of financial principles and an understanding of reporting requirements which are necessary for the evaluation and design of auditable financial systems. In addition, students develop key competencies in the financial aspects of IT management, outsourcing and project management including budgeting, statement analysis, feasibility and risk management.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject is taught through a blended learning approach that combines in-class activities and on-line learning activities. Face-to-face activities include a weekly 2-hour collaborative workshop. The workshop comprises of work integrated learning activities which revolve around the key aspects of setting up a small business. This is undertaken through a combination of theory, individual practical activities, and authentic interactive group activities and assessment items. On-line learning activities include practice activities such as online problem sets as well as readings and media watching in preparation for in-class activities. Each student will be involved in groupwork to analyse the feasibility of a start-up business. These businesses will run as though they are &#39;live businesses&#39;. Students have the responsibility to maintain their business in a professional manner for the entirety of the semester. There will be formative assessment tasks, to ensure that all students gain feedback on the given weekly tasks. This subject is delivered into three modules and each module is composed of four topics. The idea behind modules is to construct knowledge and develop skills in a meaningful sequence. To start any business, we need to understand sources and uses of cashflows in addition to working capital management. This is the first module &lsquo;financial planning&rsquo; which analyse firm&rsquo;s financial statements, ration analysis and working capital management. The second module &lsquo;value creation which is related to estimating net present value of even and uneven cashflows using different examples of income recipients, cash flow generation, loan amortisation, &hellip; etc. Module three &lsquo;corporate control&rsquo; covers identifying sources of risk and return for risk-averse, risk-neutral and risk-seekers investors. Special topics of IT outsourcing, dividend pay-out, mergers and acquisitions are analysed. Out of class activities: This subject requires students to actively engage in learning independently by utilizing the available subject material in order to develop mastery of key financial concepts required to develop strategic solutions in a financial analysis and valuation. Students are expected to read and attempt both the problems and the case studies before attending each workshop in order to actively participate in the discussion. In particular, for case studies students have to discuss their solutions in small groups, then submit the group-preferred response using audience response systems before the workshop leader provides the solutions and feedback. Lecture slides, practice questions and case studies are available to students via UTSOnline on a weekly basis. In-class activities: The 2-hour collaborative workshop consists of a review of on-line core materials (pre-work is essential), topic presentations and interactive workshop comprising a mixture of discussions, activities, case studies and informal student presentations. The weekly workshop starts with short lecture explaining the major concepts using business scenarios to link theoretical concepts to practical application. Lecturer collects questions from the discussion forum prior to each workshop and discuss them with students during the workshop. Students may have an opportunity to raise further issues at the start of a workshop. Then interactive online questions will be answered by students using Kahoot -which is a game-based platform- to test students&rsquo; understanding. This is followed by a group work by analysing short problems and real-world case studies related to lecture material. This may include class discussion with the workshop leader acting as a facilitator to stimulate active learning through student interaction and peer discussion. SPARKPLUS: Students are required to create and record a presentation of their analysis and findings. Each group will peer review and provide constructive feedback on 2 presentations. Peer assessment is to be submitted by each group member using the Self &amp; Peer Review Resource Kit (SPARK) accessible via UTSOnline. Using the SPARK toolkit each student will answer a series of questions for each group member (including themselves) to rank performance in the presentation. Online Problem Sets: Each week, students are provided with online practice problem sets via UTSOnline to test their understanding of the subject material. These problem sets include a detailed explanation of each answer and thus provide students with immediate feedback. Similar problem sets are also used for assessment, with the solutions and feedback released only after the submission deadline. Discussion Board: This is a web-based resource that can be accessed via the UTSOnline course page. The discussion board is a forum that gives students the opportunity to interact with their peers as well as with teaching staff. Students are able to post questions and comments about the course material. A member of staff will moderate the Forum and will answer students&rsquo; questions when appropriate. UTSOnline: It is a web-based tool used at UTS to provide online learning to students. UTSOnline is accessible by most web browsers, and provided you have access to an internet connection you can access UTSOnline anywhere. In the subject page, you will be able to:  Download subject material (e.g. lecture notes, practice questions, case-studies, etc.); Access the Online Problem Sets; Interact with peers and teaching staff (via Discussion Board); Keep up to date (via Announcements).  It is expected that students browse the UTSOnline page of the subject on a regular basis (at least twice a week).</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Topics covered are:  Analyse sources and uses of cash, profitability ratios and working capital management.

The main objectives of this subject are to help students acquire a fundamental knowledge of the finite elements technology, understand how different types of elements are produced, and develop an awareness of in which context these elements are used. This subject is intended primarily for engineering students who wish to develop skills in finite element methodology. The course introduces fundamental concepts as well as practical implementations, of the finite element method. This subject provides the theoretical basis for computer simulation and analysis of a vast spectrum of engineering problems. The method is used primarily in the field of structural mechanics to solve stress problems. This subject is intended as a first subject in finite elements and extends understanding of the method and its application to problems in solid/structural mechanics. Topics include: matrix analysis methods; the derivation of element stiffness matrices of bar and beam elements as well as stiffness matrices of triangular and quadrilateral elements for plane elasticity, shell and solid elements; work equivalent forces; the concept of natural coordinates and isoparametric element formulation; numerical integration and gauss points; finite element modelling techniques; and limitations, errors and solution accuracy of the Finite Element Method (FEM). This subject is also oriented toward users of the FEM and includes a hands-on laboratory component that requires the use of finite element programs in assignments. Students are exposed to the theory underlying the Finite Element Methodology. Therefore, upon successful completion of this subject students are able to conceptualise alternative finite element analysis approaches for different types of problems and ensure that adopted techniques are soundly based on fundamental principles. Students are also exposed to general purpose software in order to be able to develop modelling skills using state-of-the-art software.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject includes 3 hours of class sessions each week. Formal lectures, self-study tasks, assignments and hands-on sessions in the computing labs are used in teaching the subject. The hands-on sessions are aimed at providing a deeper insight in important topics and at reinforcing problem solving skills. The lecture material explains the problem solving techniques with the Finite Element Method. The subject material will be available at UTSOnline before the class. Students are expected to read the material before the class, answer the posted questions and prepare the input data before coming to the labs. Students are expected to be punctual and regular in attending face-to-face sessions in this subject. There will be in-class problem solving activities and short quizzes. After individually attempting each question, the students will receive feedback from their peers as a group activity as well as from the lecturer during the class discussion sessions. The types of assignments will include preparation of small written reports, completion of a self-learning module and problem solving assignments. To motivate students to learn disciplinary research skills, research inspired assessment tasks are adopted. As an example, different research projects are allocated to groups of students after meeting with them face-to-face. Students will form themselves in small groups, providing a collaborative learning experience. Students can directly connect the defined research projects to one or some of the sessions, hence, they gain a deeper understanding of the topics involved in the subject through research based learning. Constructive feedback on the progress of the project will be given early on; therefore students can address the comments in their final submissions. Students are encouraged to use the new collaborative spaces available at UTS to facilitate the required collaborative group work for planning and presenting the major assignments. The class sessions provide a collaborative learning experience. Past examination questions will be posted on UTSOnline in the form of tutorial examples, quizzes and assignments. Students are required to attempt the specified questions before coming to the class. During the class sessions, students will communicate with each other and the instructor to solve the questions. Students will be expected to consult with each other to confirm the worked solutions they have obtained. The class sessions will consist mainly of problem-solving and discussion. Students are expected to attempt the tutorial questions before their scheduled class. At the completion of the class sessions, students will be expected to complete further examination questions and submit these as assignments and receive feedback.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lecture 1 - An overview of the finite element method where the concepts of degree-of-freedom, discretization and error are introduced. For illustrative purposes stiffness coefficients of beams are obtained using the force method and incorporated for the analysis using the slope deflection method. This method is revised here because of the similarity of some aspects to finite element analysis. The intention is to introduce some concepts from the physical intuitive point of view. Matrix algebra is also revised. Lecture 2 - The essential mathematical tool of Variational Calculus is introduced. Ritz method as a direct variational method forms the foundation of the finite element derivations. Some parts can be abstract for an engineer; however, these ideas later will be fixed with examples and applications. Lecture 3 - Finite element method is introduced as a special form of the Ritz method. Nodal interpolation is introduced and continuity requirements are shown to be satisfied using interpolation. Elements that provide exact nodal solutions are shown for bar and beam problems. Lecture 4 - Beam finite element formulations are derived. Alternative beam theories are discussed from the elasticity point of view and their limitations are illustrated. We show that a-priori imposed kinematic assumptions of the beam theories significantly simplify the problem; however some conditions of elasticity are violated which can be problematic in connections, elements with holes, machine parts etc. due to local stress distribution. Lecture 5 - Elasticity solutions to some specific problems are introduced. The elasticity solution is presented directly without emphasis on the method of solution. It is shown that 2D elasticity problems can be conveniently solved numerically using membrane finite elements. Accuracies of some triangular and rectangular elements are illustrated through examples. Lecture 6 - 3D elasticity equations are introduced. Plate kinematic assumptions and the Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate theories (analogous to Euler Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams) are introduced. Governing differential equations are obtained using variational principle. Solutions for simply supported rectangular plate problems are displayed. Finite element formulations for plates are derived. Advantageous and disadvantageous aspects of Kirchhoff and Mindlin plate theories in developing finite element formulations are discussed. Lecture 7 - Several Brick elements are derived. A shell element is developed as a connection of membrane and plate elements and relevant coordinate transformations in space are discussed. Lecture 8 - Isoparametric elements and Gauss quadrature as numerical integration are introduced Lecture 9 - Locking phenomenon is introduced as an important problem in finite element analysis, which shows that FEA may not always work as expected. Methods to remedy locking issues are discussed. There will be additional 2 lectures on modelling with a general purpose commercial FEA software.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">49256</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Civil and Environmental Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This aim of this subject is to provide students with an understanding of flood estimation techniques from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Each teaching period focuses on a particular aspect of catchment modelling. There are reading materials that provide a foundation for aspects of the subject; these reading materials are provided either as a citation to published material or via UTSOnline. In the block period, these reading materials form an integral part of the discussion and the formation of technical arguments. Each student is expected to familarise themselves with the reading materials prior to arriving in class so that they can contribute to the discussion and to present a view point. As part of these discussion periods, peer review of arguments is expected. In addition, these discussion periods provide opportunities for verbal feedback to guide students in the preparation of their technical reports.

The FRM process in NSW provides for informed decision-making in the strategic management of flood risk through an appropriate:

 understanding of flood behaviour in the catchment in its current condition and in considering the long term development of the catchment
 understanding of the variation in hazard across the floodplain and its different sources and the associated consequences for existing and future development
 assessment of options to manage flood risk to existing development through mitigation measures from a broad perspective consistent with the NSW Flood Prone Land Policy
 assessment of options to develop the floodplain in consideration of flood hazard and behaviour to ensure that development extents and conditions are consistent with the maintenance of flood behaviour, the residual flood hazard and the objectives of the policy.

The subject is aimed at a wide body of students seeking a detailed knowledge and background in FRM and associated land use planning issues in NSW. The subject is supported by the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change and the Floodplain Management Authorities of NSW.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Student learning in this subject is facilitated through week O and three block sessions. In preparation for block classes students should watch the introductory video on UTSOnline. Students should reflect on the issues raised in the video and the questions posted on UTSOnline related to the video. This will be discussed during a tutorial during block 1 where students can share reflections and feedback with colleagues in tutorial groups. The discussion is moderated by the subject coordinator, affording the opportunity to provide feedback on students reflections and answers and direct further learning. Each block is comprised of lectures and tutorial sessions. Students are expected to be punctual and regular in attending the face-to-face sessions in this subject. In this subject there are numerous formative assessments activities (some do not contribute to overall assessment) from Block 1 onward that are designed to allow students to practice using their new knowledge/skills and receive feedback from the lecturer. The lectures are interactive in all aspects of the course of instruction, which will include the use of power-point presentations and selected videos. Students are expected to actively take part in class discussion to, in part, help build their communication skills as well as consolidate concepts of stormwater design. The lectures will have a practical bias. Students are expected to read the indicated materials and answer the associated online questions before the lecture so that the lecture can focus on problem solving activities individually or in small groups and any problematic material rather than parts which students can understand by themselves. There will also be computer laboratory tutorial sessions (one each block) which will be interactive and mainly focused problem solving, with discussion and feedback including in groups and on a one to one basis. All tutorial sessions provide significant opportunities for students to problem solve in a group. All relevant lecture material including notes, videos, reference material, design handbooks, tutorials, online questions, assignments, etc will be placed on UTSOnline. Teaching materials have a practical focus that aims to be relevant to professional engineering practice. Some of the workshops and tutorials may be given by guest lecturers with industry expertise to link the subject to professional engineering practice.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to Floodplain Risk Management The objectives are:  a good understanding of how FRM is undertaken in NSW and the roles of relevant agencies;  a good understanding of the principle of FRM and the desired outcomes of FRM projects;  improved skills to work on FRM projects and be more effectively involved in the FRM process; and  improved ability to specify and manage FRM projects.

In order to achieve such a goal, students delve into a theoretical background to properly support the design of databases meeting the requirements of real-world systems and the high-level design of software. The subject enables the understanding of key concepts by adopting professional tools and advanced design techniques looking at real Information Systems. Moreover, students prioritise the work in teams, and are encouraged to adopt Agile methodologies to organise and effectively execute activities that require collaboration. Students are expected to self-organise selected projects. However, they receive continuous feedback from the instructors who interact with students to give direction and provide insight. All assessment tasks are developed with learning at the fore and, hence, peer and self-assessment strategies are used extensively throughout the different learning stages. While two assessment tasks are projects that aim at the understanding of key concepts, tools and techniques in the context of Information Systems, the last assignment has a reflective character. In general, students are expected to address the feedback received to achieve project aims.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject is ideally structured in four different modules as follows: Introduction  Database and Software in everyday life Database and Software as part of an Information System  Module 1: Developing IS architectures  Agile methodology  Module 2: Database Design  Principles of Databases Data requirements in IS Database design  Module 3: Software Architecture Design  Principles of Software Engineering Software requirements in IS Describing software architecture  Module 4: Information and Software in the modern society  Case Studies analysis</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructors provide ad hoc material to support the learning process at each stage.

It is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of elementary mechanics and lay the basis for further work in this area in later subjects. In particular, material discussed in this subject is taken further in Machine Dynamics and Mechanics of Solids subjects in subsequent stages. Newtonian mechanics depends on the development of a series of increasingly complex models based on Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion. The purpose of this modelling concept is to set up an orderly development that is conducive to mathematical analysis. The methodology relies on diagrammatically isolating a physical entity (or body) from all constraints or contacts with other bodies and replacing these contacts with external forces. This relies on discriminating between what are defined as internal and external forces. The mechanically isolated body is referred to as a free body diagram. It requires a graphical, diagrammatic or visual approach to problem analysis, unlike other analytical systems, which rely on more sophisticated mathematical analysis. The topics discussed in this subject include equilibrium in 2D plane and 3D space, force vectors, force system resultants, analysis of pin-connected trusses, characteristics of dry friction, equilibrium of rigid bodies subjected to frictional force, shear force and bending moment diagrams, kinematics and kinetics of a particle, rectilinear kinemtatics, curvilinear motion, force and acceleration, work and energy, impulse and momentum, and the relationships between them. These comprise the basis of a comprehensive course in Newtonian mechanics.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject uses a problem-based learning strategy that allows students to develop their ability to apply fundamental mechanical principles, in particular, the principles of Newtonian Mechanics. This subject includes one lecture session of 1.5 hours and one tutorial session of 2.0 hours per week with a total of 3.5-hours face-to-face class time per week throughout the session. Tutors will guide tutorial sessions through solving typical problems and dynamic interactions with students. The students will be guided and assisted to reach the learning objectives with a series of milestones strategically being set throughout the session. The assessment tasks are designed to reflect the application of fundamental mechanical principles to solve basic engineering problems and to develop the professional skills. Five quizzes will be arranged during the sesssion to consolidate students&rsquo; learning. Each quiz consists of one or two problems. Students are required to solve the quiz problems individually during lecture time. This subject is a typical 6cp subject and therefore assumes a total time commitment (including class time) of approximately 70 hours, i.e. roughly 6 hours per week, for an average student aiming to pass the subject. Student learning is supported in the following way: 1. Prior to each lecture and tutorial, students will be given a set of engineering mechanics problems (including problems discussed in lectures and tutorials and problems for student self-learning) with answers. Those problems and their answers will be made available on UTSOnline/handouts. Students are expected to use these problems to help them learn engineering mechanics (statics and dynamics). 2. In some topics, video clips will be made available on UTSOnline to demonstrate the step-by-step procedure for solving problems. 3. Quiz solutions will be made available for students to review their work. 4. Academic staff will be available for one-on-one consultations on particular aspects of a student&rsquo;s work.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The topics to be covered in 11 lectures are:  Force vectors and force system resultants; Equilibrium of rigid bodies in 2D and 3D; Free-body diagrams; Two- and three-force members; Frames and machines; Pin-connected trusses.

For each game programming topic included in the content, it is a 3-step learning process. Learn the fundamentals of a topic within a lecture, both in terms of theory and practical coding examples. Expand that knowledge through self-guided study and apply it to individually graded lab exercises. In the following lab, review your learning from the previous week by discussing your solutions and reasoning with classmates. Furthermore, the major assessments for this subject involve students applying their knowledge and skill to re-create a classic game and then to expand upon this game with a novel design twist. This requires students to seek out additional knowledge required to fulfill their envisioned design. The quality of learning depends heavily on the the effort that each student puts into the weekly activities and major assessments. Games programming is a vast, complex topic and thus this subject is a platform to facilitate students&rsquo; self-guided learning on both common core topics and student selected topics that they feel will complement their own unique skill set and career path, with the lecturer/tutors there to facilitate student learning as much as possible. It is therefore important that students spend enough time out-of-class completing lab activities and assessment tasks. It is only then that students can have meaningful discussions and fruitful interactions during class hours.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Core topics (covered in lectures and labs):  Introduction to Unity &ndash; Unity interface, coordinate system, game cycle, components, GameObject, Transform Fundamentals &ndash; asset instantiation, add/get component, input management, vectors, translation/rotation/scale Working with Time &ndash; time, delta time, invoke, co-routines In-engine Animation &ndash; interpolation, programmatic tweening Animation and Audio Assets &ndash; Playing animations/audio, animation state machines, animation function calls UI Programming &ndash; UI canvas space, event registration, event listening Game State Managers &ndash; C# enumerators, switch statements, game managers, scene management Collisions - collision detection, triggers, kinematics, layers, the collision matrix Physics Programming &ndash; rigid body physics, physics materials Save Games &ndash; PlayerPrefs, resources folder, asset loading/unloading, JSON utility, file writing C# Extras &ndash; Attributes, ternary operator, statics, delegates, events</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42056</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer Science</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject exposes students to working on a research project in the broad fields of games or computer graphics.

The class meets twice a week, the first meeting is a lecture, while the second meeting will consist of a tutorial and a design forum. This subject integrates online and face-to-face experiences. Students gain first exposure to new material outside of class. Students are expected to read and think about the materials prepared for each class including lecture notes, video clips, worked examples and conceptual questions on the topic, before attending the class. Then almost half of the class time is used to do the harder work of integrating that knowledge through strategies such as problem-solving and discussion on the conceptual questions design methodologies and construction aspect of the target geotechnical structures. Students undertake a design project that runs throughout the subject. The aim of this project is to develop design skills through experience in applying the subject material, critically reviewing available information in literature, and analysing data to a practical design situation. Students should work as a team. It will be an opportunity for students to practice real world engineering problems and promote their critical thinking. Students will form themselves in small groups, providing a collaborative learning experience to produce a design project. Constructive feedback on the progress of the project will be given early on and during class time; therefore students can address the comments in their final submissions. Students are encouraged to use the new collaborative spaces available at UTS to facilitate the required collaborative group work for planning and presenting the major research project. Students undertake three open book quizzes in this subject to assess and further develop their understanding of key concepts in geotechnical engineering, problem solving skills, engineering decision making and innovative thoughts. Past examination questions and papers will be posted on UTSOnline in the form of tutorial examples, quizzes and solved assignments. Students are expected to review them, before attending the class quiz. Students undertake a number of assignments that involve problem solving and engineering decision making. The assignments will include solving the given technical problems, preparation of short written reports and completion of a self-learning module. Where feasible, assignments are designed to encourage students to work with a wide range of data inputs and apply innovative approaches. These assignments are largely self-assessed in order to allow students to gauge their understanding of the subject matter. There are many opportunities for students to receive written or oral feedback. Students will receive constructive feedback on their assignments, quizzes and group projects. One week after each quiz and submission of assignments, students will receive individual feedback as well as collective in-class feedback.

the environment. Engineers play a leading role in developing and promoting green technologies for sustaining wellbeing and preserving the environment into the future. The aim of this subject is to enable students to acquire knowledge of green technologies in theory and practice addressing technical, environmental, economic and sociocultural aspects. The subject also provides students with a better understanding of promising new green technologies related to water, solid waste and energy sectors. The green technologies investigated are those directed towards developing efficient treatment processes, recovering resources and energy, reducing the carbon footprint, minimising waste production, and protecting human and environmental health. The subject is designed to accommodate integrated study combining both environmental engineering practice and scientific principles (chemistry, biology and ecology). By reviewing literature relevant to this subject, students are able to improve critiquing skills by identifying the feasibility and applicability of the current practice. By developing problem-solving and systems-thinking skills in this subject, students are also able to apply principles of sustainability in order to achieve a distinctive holistic approach to identify advances in green technology by utilising green practices (e.g. recycling, re-use, energy efficiency, safety and health concerns, renewable resources, etc.).</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The learning activities covered in this subject include formal and informal, face-to-face teaching and discussions, online reading and learning as well as out of class activities. As students studying this subject may have different backgrounds (e.g. Environmental, Civil, Chemical, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.), during Orientation Week, students are required to undertake self-leaning and complete the online Fundamental Knowledge Recognition Test. In the 1st class, students will group together and work out the solutions for all the questions through sharing their knowledge and evaluations with other students and teaching staff. Out of class, students can also consult with staff or other students to confirm the solutions. Some questions will be re-tested in the formal quiz in Week 5. Before each class, students need to fulfill the self-learning activities by studying the online materials and completing online Pre-work Session Exercise. Students will perform self-assessment in the class through discussions and evaluations. Students will also be able to receive verbal feedback on their individual learning by making an appointment with teaching staff. Written feedback is also given on students&#39; assignments. Students will be divided into groups and acquire Australian industry experience through both invited lecturers and a field visit. Through the field trip, students are expected to link learnt knowledge with actual technologies applied, as well as apply systems thinking and research skills to write reports based on their field experience. They also need to develop effective communication skills through collaborative team work and present their findings and recommendations with respect to design, operation and maintenance to other groups. Peer feedback will be given based on assessment criteria. Out of class, students are required to engage themselves in self-learning activities through additional online materials and exercise questions that cover more practical aspects of the subject content. They can be accessed through UTSOnline. Students are required to submit assignment and reports by the due dates and participate fully in team activities and seminar presentations. They are also encouraged to undertake individually further research and reading.

Students finalise their research project based on what they studied in the first part of their honours program. This involves a substantial investigation or creative work under the supervision of a member of academic staff and is examined based on the reflection, pitch, report and the work itself. Students learn to:  implement proposed research in an independent and competent manner, and present the research in a manner that demonstrates competencies in conducting research and presenting the outcomes in a scholarly manner.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is a project-based subject that requires students to undertake significant independent work with self-directed learning in their own time under the supervision of an academic staff member to demonstrate their readiness to graduate.

It should be clear that the intellectual effort expended on Honours Project is no less than that normally required to pass course work of the same number of credit points.

This is how human-centred design makes people central to the design process. There are many human-centred design methods and several of them are touched on in other interaction design subjects. In this subject we give an overview of the breadth of these methods and focus on two different methods: interviewing and cultural probes. Interviewing is one of the most popular methods in human-centred design. The many reasons include the fact that interviewing provides direct information from interviewees, is relatively easy to do (though difficult to do well) and is inexpensive. The interviewing method is flexible in its use, exists in a large number of variations and can be used at any stage of the design process. Cultural probes, by contrast, is a design method that requires sets of props (probes) which are specifically created or collected to be issued to participants to elicit their response. This method is open and creative, and needs more preparation, but has the potential to generate inspirational responses that can inform design. In this subject students implement both the interviewing method and the cultural probe method, step-by-step through guidance. Students are given a brief that is fairly open where each student can choose their own variation on the theme to guide their interviewing and cultural probe implementation. Examples are shared of different interview and probe variations, and the student can choose to implement the ones that fit their goal best.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Learning in this subject is comprised of three elements: self-directed study, class meetings (1 hour per block week, thus not every week), and practical tutorials (1 hour per block week, thus not every week). First and foremost, this subject requires a significant amount of self-directed study and work outside of class hours. Self-study will include watching videos about the subject material and reading state-of-the-art papers on human-centred design methods used in research, which will be made available through UTSOnline and the UTS Library. These should be studied as preparation before each class meeting. The class meetings will be with both cohorts 32405 &amp; 41020, and will include a mix of activities, such as lectures, Q&amp;As, discussions, a quiz and an interview. The information offered during self-directed study and class meetings are necessary input for the students to be able to participate in the tutorials. Tutorials will be with smaller groups, and are designed to support and guide the students through the necessary steps to implement human-centred design methods for the main deliverables. Students are encouraged to discuss, critique, and learn from each other. Tutors are available to stimulate such discussions and provide guidance and formative feedback. Interactivity, as in conversation between teaching staff and students, is important in this subject. Students are highly encouraged to ask and answer questions, be active and proactive, for example by sharing things they have learned (both in class meetings as well as tutorials). The more interactive each class meeting or tutorial is, the more the students will learn (especially the ones being interactive), but also the better the teachers can tailor the subject material to the students&rsquo; needs. Therefore, it is in the students&rsquo; interest to participate in class. Note that in the program not all weeks have class meetings and tutorials scheduled. This allows the students to pursue their research tasks. Please note that:  Students are expected to carry out reading for the subject before and during its delivery. It is highly recommended to read beyond the provided materials. This subject is intended to give students practical experience in user research projects using methods widely used in industry and academia. Most of the actual research and the preparation of data for analysis will be done outside of class time. In class students will be guided through the set-up of these projects, they will be prepared for a practice run, which will be discussed in class, all preparing them to head off and execute the project themselves. Again, in class it will be explained how to analyse the findings, they will try one example together, to then analyse their own findings outside of class.

Typically, one session is on hydraulics and the other session is on hydrology. Students are expected to be punctual and regular in attending the face-to-face sessions in the subject. Each session is typically comprised of approximately 1 hr lecture and 1 hr tutorial. There will also be computer modelling sessions during some of the tutorial sessions. Students are encouraged to participate in all aspects of the subject, including interacting with power-point presentations and selected videos. The lectures will have a practical focus linking to professional practice. Students are expected to have read the weekly reading materials and answer associated online questions before the lecture. This will allow the lecture time to focus on problem solving activities, and allow students to work through scenarios representative of professional practice. The tutorial sessions will be mainly dedicated to problem solving, and opportunities for discussion and feedback. All relevant lecture material, including notes, tutorials, online questions, assignments, etc will be housed on the University&rsquo;s learning management system UTSOnline. Teaching materials include practical examples to help students link the subject to what is undertaken in professional practice. The lecture sessions comprise a hydraulic component and a hydrology component. The hydraulics component provides students with an understanding of the nature of open channel flows, it temporal and spatial variation, relating them to the theories of conservation of fluid energy and momentum to quantify actual flow behaviour. The hydrology sessions are organised into three parts to cover the three thematic topics which make up the hydrology component of the subject i.e. rainfall generation, surface runoff and flood estimation. The lectures for this session will provide an overview of the topic area with students encouraged to explore in-depth the material made available on UTSOnline. Students are strongly encouraged to actively take part in class discussion, in part, to help build their understanding of the subject content.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Meteorology and Meteorological Data, Climatology, Hydrological Data, Statistical Analysis in Hydrology, Hydrological Models, Rainfall Losses, Surface Runoff, Estimation of Design Flows, Unit Hydrographs, Yield Analysis, Evaporation, Groundwater, Energy Principles for Open Channel Flow, Critical Flow and Froude Number, Conservation of Momentum, Uniform and Non-Uniform Flow, Gradually Varied Steady Flow Analysis, HEC-RAS Steady Flow Modelling, Unsteady Flow Modelling.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">41193</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C10395 Bachelor of Information Systems</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Information, Systems and Modelling</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Taking the Information Systems (IS) perspective (rather than the more common Data Science or IT perspectives), this studio subject focuses on the latest developments and professional practices in data visualisation and visual analytics for non-technical decision-makers. Recognising the importance of data visualisation literacy in various disciplines including IS, the subject differs from other more common data visualisation subjects by emphasising (i) learning the whys behind doing data visualisation in addition to the how to dos, (ii) identifying business/organisational cases and their requirements, the stakeholders, and their problem space and decision-making needs, (iii) visual ethics and responsible use of visual data, and (iv) utilising commercial data visualisation software instead of elaborate coding. In short, the subject treats visualisation as a &ldquo;verb&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;noun&rdquo; and aims for visual problem exploration &ldquo;through data&rdquo; rather than creation of static visual outputs. To this end, the subject is taught in a studio setting with a focus on design thinking exercises and ethical visual analytics. Students develop the necessary skills and the mindset for problem finding and solving through visual data exploration that goes beyond creation of static visual outputs. These skills include identification of different stakeholders and analysis of their decision-making needs and environments, problem formulation, finding and ethical harvesting of relevant data, data quality, data integration, multidimensional modelling, and development of a data exploration prototype using a commercial data visualisation software. Focusing on value creation and decision-making needs of different stakeholders, students also learn how to use data-driven visual storytelling and other contemporary techniques to explore the problem space, inform, influence and inspire different types of stakeholders (including business and IT).</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is structured around a major visual data exploration project designed to support decision-making of non-technical stakeholders. The subject consists of weekly 3h studios. Each studio is designed to help students to build the necessary foundational knowledge and skills as well as confidence and inspiration to successfully complete the given project. Weekly studios are highly interactive and emphasise active learning, collaboration and an appreciation of the complexities of contemporary data visualization and visual analytics professional practices of non-technical decision makers in real-life settings. Studios include a variety of learning and teaching activities such as short presentations, group and individual problem-solving activities focusing on different aspects of interactive data exploration, project work, learning circles, project stakeholder analysis and project presentations as well as group feedback and peer review activities. Students are immersed in the world of professional practice in visual data exploration for decision-making through boundary-spanning activities, transdisciplinary innovation, engagement with process stakeholders, appreciative inquiry, data humanism, data-driven storytelling and value co-creation as well as critical thinking about the ethics of data collection, integration and visualisation (including visual ethics).

The extracted information is at the basis of many innovative applications such as video surveillance, diagnosis from medical images, automatic indexing and retrieval of multimedia data, human-computer interaction. This subject gives students the ability to understand the principles of image processing and pattern recognition and develop software for the automatic analysis and interpretation of images and videos. The goal of this subject is to teach skills used by professional engineers working at developing image processing and computer vision products, services and solutions. During the this project students apply the knowledge they have gained to scope, solve, test and communicate a solution to a real-world image processing problem in a collaborative team-based environment. Examples include detection of people and objects in video surveillance, automated diagnosis from medical images, and detection and recognition of faces in imagery.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Formal and informal, face-to-face, online and out of class engagement by students constitutes a large part of the learning activities that are covered in this subject. The subject consists of a 1 and a half hour workshop and a 1 and half hour tutorial. Students should prepare for each of these classes by accessing the weekly preparation material in UTSOnline that will generally consist of short videos and guided questions on topics related to the subject matter presented in that class. In each lecture slot students will discuss the preparation material and then more in-depth content will be presented. In each tutorial slot, the students will do exercises using MATLAB to practice their understanding of the concepts with verbal feedback from the tutors. These exercises can be done individually or in small groups. For the next 6 weeks of the subject, the students will be working on a group project. The students will group together into small teams and apply the knowledge they have gained in the course of the previous classes to solve a real world image processing problem. Students are expected to apply learnt content, problem solving and research skills to write a specification of the problem they are attempting to solve, implement the solution and present the solution to the class. To complete this task successfully, students will need to work effectively in a team as well as research the problem individually and in a group outside of the class and bring that knowledge to the sessions. A formative feedback quiz will be given in class during week 4 with feedback on correct answers and a worked solution given by the tutor to help students assess their understanding of the subject content. Feedback from the lecturer will also be given at various points during the group project. Firstly, written feedback will be given on the submitted design specification for the project, this feedback can help students with the second assessment task. Secondly, verbal feedback from both the lecturer and tutors during the project sessions to help students gauge how they are progressing. Additionally, there will be a point mid-way through the project where students will provide formative peer feedback on group contribution. Weekly 1 and a half hour lecture and 1 and a half hour tutorial, both preferably in a lab room.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">1. Image and video representation 2.

Industrial wastewaters have often very different characteristics from domestic and municipal wastewaters which make it very difficult to successfully treat in a sustainable way. The main objective of this subject is to provide the opportunity for students to understand the principles of industrial wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse in order to minimise pollution in a sustainable manner. To get an in-depth understanding of the treatment and disposal of industrial wastewater, this subject commences with classification, characterisation and quantification of industrial wastes. The subject focuses on the principles and mechanisms of pollutant removal, the processes and design of conventional (primary, secondary and tertiary) and advanced (post-treatment) technologies applied in the treatment of industrial effluent. Various environmental management concepts relating to industrial pollution prevention/pollution reduction at source, Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD), and cleaner production are covered. Special emphasis is given to water conservation and recycling since these allow more flexibility and have economic value as a water supply. The subject includes various management practices of industrial waste, i.e. environmental auditing, trade waste policy, environmental rules and legislation, license agreements, etc., to mitigate industrial pollution. Therefore, the subject brings both engineering and management together to prevent and reduce the pollution created by the industrial sector.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Summer session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In this subject student learning is coordinated and facilitated through pre-work and face-to-face sessions in three block sessions of one and a half days each. Students are required to participate in group activities organised in the class room, undertake specified activities to prepare for in-class participation and attend a self-organised field trip. There will be preparatory reading material and web links posted online, and students are expected to undertake research on different topics, and bring this material to class to enable them to contribute to design activities through collaborative learning. The preparation activities may include reading, watching videos, and researching topics. The particular activities will be listed on UTSOnline prior to each block. Class time will be used for group learning that will include problem solving and discussion. Student learning will also be assessed via class assignments so as to enable them to receive immediate feedback. Block 1 typically occurs before the HECS census date providing multiple opportunities for feedback. All students are required to undertake a field visit in a group, and use the knowledge in developing skills to design a treatment system for an industry. Students are also required to share this knowledge through collaborative learning which will then be assessed by peers and teachers. Further details of the field trip will be provided via UTSOnline. NOTE: At UTS, an average student aiming to pass the subject is expected to commit approximately 150 hours of study for a 6 credit point subject.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Classification, characterisation and quantification of industrial wastewater Characteristics of specific industrial wastewater Physical, chemical and biological treatment of industrial wastewater Advanced treatment technologies for industrial wastewater such as advanced oxidation, membrane filtration, ion exchange, etc. Industrial wastewater reuse technology and practices Full scale design of industrial wastewater treatment plant Environmental auditing in industries Waste minimisation principles Wastewater treatment for some specific industries such as Paper and Pulp, Tannery, Textile, Dairy, Abattoirs, Mining, Construction, Metal processing industries.

The slides include directions on how to solve different problems arising out of the system at different times. Questions arise from discussions and experiences, these are proposed and discussed in tutorial groups. In class the lecturer explains the complex background for each topic based on these UTSOnline materials and encourages students to use their sense making to clarify their interpretations through verbal feedback. Tutorials will commence in Week 3. Tutorials follow the class, in which students form groups. Each week, fifteen minutes is spent to discuss feedback on the assessment tasks. Students work in groups and are given questions based on a case study. They are required to use design thinking to define the problem and encouraged to come up with solution ideas that they present to the whole class. Students are expected to critique and evaluate each other&rsquo;s responses. This imparts peer feedback on a weekly basis so that students learn from one another.

Later subjects in data engineering, communications systems and image processing rely heavily on the mathematical groundwork and system framework in this subject. A strong laboratory component is emphasised to equip students with hands-on experience and the ability to apply theoretical concepts to a number of practical communication and signal/image processing systems. Students are also encouraged to be involved in a collaborative research project in information and signal theory.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject consists of theoretical study, tutorials, lab experiments, and a collaborative research project. For the theory, students will be taught using a mixture of online lectures, digital media, in-class interactive seminars with quizzes, and tutorials. To prepare for the seminar and the in-class computer-based quiz of each week, students are required to watch the week&rsquo;s online lecture, read related notes, and attempt exercises in the notes (on UTSOnline). Students then collaborate during the tutorials to reflect their understanding of concepts on the notes&rsquo; exercises with feedback and help from the tutors. To equip students with hands-on experience in using the tools, equipment that are currently used in the related industry, there are 3 lab components. In these labs, each group of 2-3 students experiment with equipment like digital storage oscilloscope (Agilent DSO-X 2004A with Wave Gen), Arbitrary Waveform Generator (Agilent 33210A with Option 002), TIMS trainer, and software tools like Matlab, LabView. Additionally, an online discussion forum is used to allow students to pose questions, and more importantly, to answer each other&rsquo;s questions and get feedback from lecturers and tutors. Students are expected to log into the forum on a frequent basis to read the messages and to engage in dialogue on the subject matter. Students who attempt to obtain a Distinction or High Distinction in the subject will form groups of 2-3 to work on a research project in information theory and signal processing. In the project, students&rsquo; fundamental skills in research will be trained and assessed through feedback and written reports that contain a literature review, simulating/replicating others&rsquo; research findings and critical/creative thinking beyond the provided resources. Weekly verbal and written feedback is integrated into classes, tutorials, online forum, and labs to provide students with opportunities to guide and inform their work and assignment understanding. Students are also strongly encouraged to attend the weekly consultation hour to ask questions or discuss in-person with the lecturer, especially for the research project assignment. Plagiarism and Detection Software: Plagiarism is a serious offence. We use Turnitin to check students&#39; assignment for plagiarism (lab and project reports). The system is able to detect almost all plagiarism practices. To be able to submit reports to the system, your report must be typed/edited using text editors (e.g., Latex, MS Word...). Reports can also include images/scans (e.g., from lab experiment...). However, if the report contains only images/scans, the report cannot be submitted to the system. It is students&#39; responsibility to properly submit their reports to Turnitin in the system.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">1. Introduction to information theory 2.

Collaborative work will take place during class and there will be opportunities for peer learning and review. The emphasis on team-based learning means all students are expected to attend all sessions.  Students will access supplementary materials via UTSOnline to support their learning about the capability of strategical thinking and effectively undertake the responsibility of learning, particularly in fundamental knowledge of modern electronics, integrated circuit components and systems design. The students are expected to reach out the resources at UTSOnline, lecture videos and other associated reading materials. Laboratory classes will allow students to have access to the most powerful advanced electronic circuit design system. Students are expected to gain the experience of using software tools for circuits modelling, component and system level designs. A series of case studies and simulations will be presented during week 2 to week 10, and students will be given the opportunities to work individually or in group for the project based tasks. Formative feedback will be provided in weeks 3, 5, 7, 10 for the quizzes, in the form of verbal and written during laboratories.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electronics Engineering  Originality of Electronics Engineering How it is evolved and the importance of Electronics Engineering on our daily life.

In order for any engineered system to fulfil its purpose in a sustained manner, the system itself must be sustained and supported. This role invariable is assigned to a 'support system'. This means that this support system must be envisaged, created and used with just as much care, thought and rigour as the system it supports. Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) is a key discipline that allows dealing with this requirement when developing, using and managing a support system. It allows the highlighting of the factors that are crucial to mission success at an early stage, using a life-cycle-based approach, and ensures that these factors are appropriately encapsulated in any system acquisition and operation.
This subject provides students with an introduction to ILS. It uses concepts from systems thinking and engineering to contextualise ILS and its importance in systems development, management and support. Students are encouraged to consider the applicability of concepts and techniques used to support various systems and their value in dealing with complexity.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject is delivered in Block mode.

An in-class peer assessment session will be organised to verify students&rsquo; understanding of IoT technology. Out-of-class, students are expected to be involved in self-learning activities, including reading the textbook, recommended articles and reports, studying the lecture slides, watching relevant videos. Students are required to participate in discussions during the class and on a discussion board forum that is available online for students to post questions for other students and teaching staff to provide answers for. Pre-class preparatory activities include reading and critical review of the content of the lecture slides prior to attending lectures and tutorials.

The project will typically involve either delivering an industry-standard system or solution using knowledge and skills covered in the internetworking and applications major, or will involve academic research in the field. In either case, students will be required to review existing literature in their chosen topic area. There are normally no classes, other than an information session in Week 1, where all enrolled students and supervisors are invited to clarify the detailed requirements of the project. Students will normally have weekly or fortnightly meetings with their supervisor to discuss their progress, and to receive feedback. For the remainder of the semester, students are not required to attend any formal classes. Being a group-work based subject, students are required to form a group of up to six (6) members and to finalise the selection of their project with their nominated supervisor by the end of Week 2. Students will be required to stay and work in the same nominated group throughout the project. Group members are expected to meet for at least 1.5 hours per week for project discussions, and spend an additional 7-9 hours each week in self-directed work towards their share of the project. Also, each group as a whole is required to meet with their supervisor (face-to-face) at least four (4) times throughout the semester to discuss and monitor the progress of their project. The following are suggested guidelines for these meetings:  1st Meeting (before Week 1): Initial discussion about the project topic 2nd Meeting (by Week 3): Learning contract and project plans 3rd Meeting (by Week 6): Mid-project review 4th Meeting (by Week 8): Final discussion before submission  All members in the group are expected to attend these meetings, and a logbook is required to record every meeting with group members and the supervisor. This logbook must be maintained by one member of the group. Deliverables or drafts should be provided to the supervisor before attending the meetings in Weeks 3, 6 and 8 (as above), and feedback will be provided by the supervisor during the meetings. It is the group members&#39; responsibility to record this feedback in their logbook.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48210</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Professional Practice and Leadership</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject focuses on developing engineering students' approaches to understanding the interactions between engineering and society from a philosophical, sociological and political perspective.

Those classes allow for groups of students to collaborate in preparation for assignments. Feedback for assignments are provided to students in a number of ways including UTS Online one-to-one feedback, group feedback, and peer reviews. Groups investigate stakeholders that could be affected by a particular technology and construct a convincing case for consultation. Individually, students develop a policy position paper on behalf of one of those stakeholders. This hinges on good communication and research skills which will take the form of reporting, presenting, and debating.

It is not as simple as just having an idea or jumping straight into coding or creating visual assets without a plan. A high-quality game design must be well structured and documented, carefully crafted for a specific target audience, communicated and negotiated with a team of other designers, scoped to be implementable by a given team of developers within time constraints, and evaluated and iterated on many times until a finely tuned game experience emerges. A professional game designer is an engineer of entertainment. Thus, in this subject, students will be taught the theoretical concepts and practical methodologies needed to ideate, communicate, implement, and improve upon your designs. In this way, students will learn to combine their existing software and game development skills with creativity and iterative design thinking to craft compelling interactions between players and the system of rules that govern them. Students will start by applying these theories and process to the creation of a physical board game prototype before moving on to creating a digital game in a popular game engine. This subject does not teach game development (e.g. coding or art asset creation) but instead requires students to self-learn what is needed to implement their group&#39;s shared vision. Students will adopt a kit-bashing approach to rapidly prototype and iterate on their game designs and playtest them with other students on a weekly basis to collect and analyse feedback. By the end of the session, students will have both a board game and digital game that are novel and refined, which can be used in future employment portfolios to highlight interaction design skills in entertainment domains.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject provides active learning opportunities in a collaborative environment. It focuses on the practical application of game design theories to build commercial-ready games. Students are expected to produce a physical board game and a digital game at the end of this subject. The top performing groups of the session are typically invited to the Autumn Student Games Showcase. Each year, this event sees more than two hundred students, staff, industry partners, research collaborators, and family members come to UTS to view games projects from around the faculty and judge the winners for the best games of the night. In each week, students are expected to have completed any videos or reading material provided on UTSOnline before the lecture, in which these concepts will be discussed in more detail. The lectures will involve new content presented from the instructor, as well as group activities around the pre-lecture material. In the weekly two-hour labs, students will normally complete group activities that build towards their board and digital games. These activities will guide students through the designing, documenting, and playtesting processes by utilizing theory and practices presented in the lecture. Students are expected to attend these labs every week to effectively contribute to their group. If a group member cannot attend on a given week, they should be in contact with the group through other means to coordinate the next week&#39;s activities. Groups will conduct playtests on their designs each week during the lab time, starting from Week 2. This allows for multiple weeks of formative feedback from other students and teaching staff to enhance their designs before the final submissions of the board game and digital game assessments.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Major topics covered in this subject are:  The Process of Designing a Game: Conceptualization, paper and digital prototyping, playtesting, game balance, fun.

For each game programming topic included in the content, it is a 3-step learning process. Learn the fundamentals of a topic within a lecture, both in terms of theory and practical coding examples. Expand that knowledge through self-guided study and apply it to individually graded lab exercises. In the following lab, review your learning from the previous week by discussing your solutions and reasoning with classmates. Furthermore, the major assessments for this subject involve students applying their knowledge and skill to re-create a classic game and then to expand upon this game with a novel design twist. This requires students to seek out additional knowledge required to fulfill their envisioned design. The quality of learning depends heavily on the the effort that each student puts into the weekly activities and major assessments. Games programming is a vast, complex topic and thus this subject is a platform to facilitate students&rsquo; self-guided learning on both common core topics and student selected topics that they feel will complement their own unique skill set and career path, with the lecturer/tutors there to facilitate student learning as much as possible. It is therefore important that students spend enough time out-of-class completing lab activities and assessment tasks.

Data is all pervasive in modern society. Data engineers both build the infrastructure that enables this, but also participate in the manipulation and analysis of the data. The subject takes a practical, hands-on approach designed to inspire and motivate students in all facets of data engineering. These include the gathering, processing and analysis of data, as well as decision-making and actuation in relation to data. Students create their own data sets to use in a number of group and individual projects. MATLAB is core to the subject and students become proficient in its use for modelling and analysis. This is a field of practice subject undertaken by all students enrolled in a Data Engineering major. Students from other majors or faculties may also enrol.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject is carried out through a series of small and large projects undertaken in the field and in laboratories, supported by a combination of lectures and online resources. Students work in teams on the assignments involving problem definition, research, and analysis. The faculty expects a commitment of nine hours per week for the subject, some of which occurs during class time. Students are expected to attend all timetabled sessions. Ultimately learning is the student&#39;s responsibility. It is an aim of this subject to help students develop strategies that will enable them to more effectively undertake the responsibility of learning. These strategies will help students throughout the rest of their course and later in practice. In this subject students are encouraged to recognise the resources around them, and to use them. Specific strategies include:  Establishment of study groups to encourage collaborative learning with group members. Plenary resource sessions during which information and guidance regarding the teaching staff&rsquo;s expectations of students will be presented. A fieldwork and laboratory programs of team and individual projects. Individual reflection.  Team projects help to develop skills such as:  Teamwork (skills in working within team dynamics; leadership skills); Analysis and cognition (analysing task requirements; questioning; critically interpreting material; evaluating the work of others); Collaboration (conflict management and resolution; accepting intellectual criticism; flexibility; negotiation and compromise); and Organisational and time management skills  Some of the concepts and ideas that students encounter while studying in this subject may be difficult to understand. A range of supplementary learning materials such as Lynda.com online courses will be made available.

A real-world problem and its solution (an electronic artefact) will be a central part of the subject, and form a framework around which many technical and non-technical aspects of engineering can be illustrated. In terms of knowledge, basic electrical concepts such as voltage, current, resistance and power are introduced; simple circuit analysis techniques for DC and AC circuits are studied; electric and magnetic fields are used to introduce the capacitor and inductor; and computer-based systems and sensors are shown as applications of this basic knowledge. Particular emphasis will be placed on the practical, hands-on aspects of electronics. Laboratory work will include circuit construction, testing and troubleshooting, as well as the use of test instruments such as multimeters and oscilloscopes.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campusSpring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Students are required to undertake independent learning before attending timetabled activities. Independent Learning UTSOnline Students are required to study UTSOnline material. This includes: reading the Topic Notes and undertaking the associated problems watching videos that develop key ideas slowly with illustrated examples that emphasise the practical applications of the theory engaging with other Open Educational Resources via hyperlinks Textbook Students are required to read the specified sections of the textbook and undertake the associated problems. WebTutor WebTutor is custom-written software that presents students with exercises based on the subject topics. The exercises are unique, as they are randomly generated by WebTutor each time an exercise is viewed. Students are able to practice questions on a topic as many times as they like. This allows students to focus on a particular topic, to pace their learning, and to obtain immediate feedback on their efforts. Online help is available for most exercises from within WebTutor. Open Lab The laboratory is made available to students for out-of-class learning. Students, in groups of two, are encouraged to fully complete the laboratories before the timetabled assessment. This allows students to: practise using the laboratory equipment to achieve a basic level of proficiency gain skill in circuit construction, testing, and troubleshooting learn at their own pace so they understand the content and procedures before being assessed Timetabled Activities Lecture (whole-of-class activity) There is a 1-hour lecture (whole-of-class activity) in Week 1 and in Week 12. These are used to bookend the subject. The Week 1 lecture introduces the subject and requires students to undertake 2 activities in small groups and report to the class as a whole. The Week 12 lecture reflects on the subject&rsquo;s experiences and concludes the subject. Tutorial There is one 2-hour tutorial every week, broken into two consecutive 1-hour parts. The first part sees students working at tables in groups of up to 8 students on certain design or analysis aspects of an engineering design. This puts the content of the subject into an immediate context. The second part sees students working individually on set problems relating to technical content, and using the group for peer learning. Tutors do not present solutions to problems but act to facilitate collaborative discussions amongst the group (or whole class) where needed. Answers to the tutorial problems are only available after the tutorials have been conducted - this allows students to form their own solutions independently of a &#39;model answer&#39;, and encourages students to check with the tutor whether their approach to the solution was correct, or could be improved upon. The tutorial appears on the UTS Timetable Planner as a &#39;Drp&#39; activity. Laboratory There is one 3-hour laboratory every week. The subject places a particular emphasis on the practical, hands-on aspects of electronics. Students are required to purchase an electronics kit and work in groups of two. Each lab involves the construction and testing of several circuits that are used in real applications. Some of the circuits involve elements of design. The aim is for students to become proficient in moving from theory to practice. The recording, graphing and interpretation of practical results, and how they compare with theory, is also practised. During the lab, students can seek assistance from a lab tutor in relation to the experimental procedure, the expected results, and the use of the equipment. At the end of each lab session, a lab tutor will assess the previous week&rsquo;s lab work and provide immediate feedback. Practical competence will be assessed during two Laboratory Tests.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Content can be broadly categorised into the following:  The engineering process, creating new products and systems, functional specifications and block diagrams.

The Tut tutorial classes make use of active, interactive and collaborative teaching and learning methods. Students are expected to have completed pre-class activities such as watching lecture videos and/or attending Lec classes. There may also be other activities such as online quizzes and introductory practice problems to complete prior to coming to Tut classes. Students should not expect to just sit passively and wait to get solutions to example problems (there is a Sample Engineering Mechanics Problems with Solutions booklet and also many worked example problem videos available for that). Students should make use of this booklet and the videos outside of class time to help them practice and learn engineering mechanics methods. Students are required to demonstrate their understanding and ability to apply these methods via two in-class quizzes. The computer labs provide an opportunity for students to get assistance with Computer Aided Design (CAD) using SolidWorks. The Lab classes involve tutor-assisted self-directed learning.

An overview of the agile and non-agile software development principles, methods, tools and techniques is presented. Current trends and challenges in the practice of software development are explored. In this subject, students learn how to design, develop and evaluate software that implements commercially realistic but manageably small software requirements. Most often the task is to modify or extend some existing software feature or function but can also be to create new features or functions. Peer learning and collaboration are encouraged but, ultimately, each student must complete their tasks individually.

Student learning in the subject is facilitated by a combination of: 1. Active learning tasks to reinforce and consolidate learning. Tasks are scheduled for each teaching session week (see &quot;Program&quot; below) The tasks include text reading, undertaking self-assessment/evaluation problems and completing computer based tests. The subject&rsquo;s Reading Material and Exercises book (RME) is a collection of resources used for both in-class and out of class learning activities. It contains readings to supplement the set text. The readings serve to amplify points in the text or illustrate a different emphasis. Included exercises are designed to encourage thoughtful reading of the text, to allow self-testing of comprehension and to encourage reflection on implications for industry and real life practice. The coordinator&rsquo;s sample responses to a reasonable proportion of the exercises are provided to scaffold engagement by the student, offer immediate feedback and to assist productive self-assessment of learning. The assessment regime of the subject requires every student to have some involvement with the learning opportunities associated with the RME. However, the resource also offers extension subject matter. The RME is particularly valuable for those students who wish to do more than just study the basics and offers an opportunity to gain a far more rounded and deeper understanding of judgment and decision making than will be achieved by simply focusing on the text, assignments and examination preparation. 2. Contact meetings that incorporate:  Blended lectures that aim at providing supplementary explanation and broader real-life context to many of the theoretical concepts contained in text. Information is drawn from the text and the literature and some synthesis is attempted. A degree of practicality is introduced through anecdotes, which assists the student make connections to an industry framework. Collaborative single sentence response tasks aimed at identifying the level of understanding of important concepts. Small group collaborative quizzes, discussion exercises and problems. Collaborative student guided completion of structured decision problems. Student presentations and peer review and feedback. Question and answer sessions offering an opportunity to progressively raise queries and to discuss and clarify concepts regarding text content and assignment tasks.  Student engagement is required in all small group activities embedded in the contact meetings. Many of the activities promote the benefit of establishing a small out of class study group that meets regularly. Students have access to an extensive set of digital self-learning resources. These resources have been developed and organised to assist a student to work through the subject topics and the text in a measured and comprehensive manner. They may be downloaded or streamed from Canvas. 3. Encouraged consultation directly after contact meetings and by out of meeting email correspondence. Questions raised as part of this consultation will form the basis of daily announcements that provide advice, guidance and feedback via Canvas. The announcements aim at assisting student learning and motivating continuous engagement. 4. Completion of three online tests for each of the eight sections in the RME book. When considered in total, these twenty-four tests provide continuous formative assessment. The tests are designed to assist students to understand many of the subtilties contained in the text. Computer provided feedback is available on completion of each test. The tests allow students to immediately become aware of their strengths and weaknesses and to address knowledge and/or understanding deficiencies. Students may retake the tests multiple times and at any stage of the teaching session. 5. Assignments that reinforce aspects of theories set out in the text but are also designed and structured to allow students to reflect on real life application and to develop practical skills. 6. Use of similarity detection software. Each assignment offers at least one opportunity to submit a draft and obtain similarity feedback. This allows the student to reflect on their success in putting information in their own words and where necessary to appropriately reference the words of others. 7. Study for the final examination. (An early to mid-session class activity is used to encourage discussion of possible exam preparation study approaches). Note: Feedback from Week 1 tasks; Management Setting Tests 1, 2 and 3; Decision Analysis Tests 1, 2 and 3 and a number self-assessment problems are all available prior to the census date for the teaching session. Study approach The Subject Outline for the specific session of study being undertaken must be read in conjunction with the Supplementary Instructions. Both documents will be posted on Canvas and provide information and advice on many facets of the subject content, its administration and the student&rsquo;s obligations. It is mandatory that students obtain, read and comply with the requirements of both the subject outline and supplementary instructions. All key subject announcements will be made using Canvas. Students are expected to regularly check the announcements page for information. Whilst your study approach is a personal choice, do keep in mind that this subject is not one that can be mastered by some cursory reading and frantic activity prior to the due dates for assignments and reviewing the material a few weeks prior to the final exam. A willingness to take personal responsibility is a key element of successful learning. It is estimated that you should set aside a minimum total of approximately 9 hours of study time per week (inclusive of any face to face contact) throughout the session. This is a rough guide only as people learn at different rates and will approach the subject from different backgrounds and levels of experience and have different ambitions and expectations in regard to outcomes. To maximise your learning from this subject you should work consistently and progressively throughout all weeks of the teaching session. The best way to achieve this is to plan your study time at the beginning of the session and make sure you adhere to the planned schedule. In developing a study schedule please note that you will find that the information load in each topic is not identical, for example &ldquo;The Management Setting&rdquo; exceeds that of the others by a factor of about two and may need proportionally greater effort and time. &quot;Decision Analysis&quot; requires the understanding that can only be developed by attempting the set of self-assessment problems. Many of the subject insights are associated with human behaviour and bias, they often take people considerable time to process and fully come to terms with and absorb. Also be aware of the assignment due dates as they set time limits for achieving necessary competence in some aspects of material comprehension and subject objectives. It is also reasonable to expect assignment deadlines will add a potential work load peak. Assessment task 1 aims at encouraging you to immediately commence detailed study of the subject content and to use the text and the reading material in a thoughtful and productive manner. The subject is literature based. The approach is very academic in the traditional sense, information is drawn from the body of knowledge and some synthesis is attempted. A degree of practicality is introduced through anecdotes, which lightens the experience for the student and assists them make connections to an industry framework. The contact meetings and available subject resources (refer &quot;Required texts&quot; and &quot;Other resources&quot;) focus on students undertaking conscientious engagement with significant components of a body of knowledge. It is important to understand the difference between rote learning and the development of expertise. Rote learning merely helps you retain material in your Short Term Memory. &lsquo;Elaborative rehearsal&rsquo; which places the material into your Long Term Memory is crucial for the development of professional expertise. Elaborative rehearsal requires you to pay attention to the meaning of the material (understanding) and, in the process, try to relate items with each other and with the structure of the facts and evidence. Elaborative rehearsal will place the material into &lsquo;schemata&rsquo;, or structures in your cognition that relate one item to another, rather than into groups of disjointed facts. This is the underlying basis of expertise and will enhance efficiency during the formal examination and better application of domain knowledge in stressful industry situations. The Canvas tests and contact meeting activities will aid elaborative rehearsal.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The list below sets out the seven basic topics of the subject and the appropriate chapters in the textbook and the Reading Material and Exercises book (RME):  The Management Setting; chapters 1, 2 and 3; RME section 1 Decision Analysis; chapter 4; RME section 2 Multi-attribute Decisions; chapter 5; RME section 3 Engineering and Social Risk; chapter 6; RME section 4 Cognitive Processes; chapter 7; RME section 5 Individual and Group Decisions; chapters 8 and 9; RME sections 6 and 7 Strategic Decisions; chapters 10, 11 and 12; RME section 8  The Reading Material and Exercises book is divided into eight sections.

In the laboratory, a workshop approach is used which combines learning by doing small group activities, hands-on labs, Q&amp;A sessions, and online tests. It is expected that, for each week&#39;s lecture, tutorial and lab, students will need to spend additional six hours in self-directed study. Pre-studying the chapters (textbook and/or ELearning materials) before they are covered in class is essential for students&rsquo; success in this subject. Electronic textbooks, as well as ELearning materials, including video lectures and interactive exercise or quizzes, are widely used for this subject. Careful notes made during students&rsquo; self-directed pre-study will greatly assist with the written exam and the online exams. During lab sessions, students should make careful notes in their Engineering Journals which will be very helpful with the skills based assessments. The Final Written Exam questions will also come from these sources. Nearly all hands-on activities are based on group work. Groups are formed from within a class, where each group typically has four students. Groups are set up at the beginning of the session and are expected to work together on a weekly basis and for practical assessments. However, most marks are allocated to tasks where each student is marked individually. Also, in-class discussions and Q&amp;A sessions are conducted for most lab sessions to facilitate active, collaborative learning. An online discussion forum on UTS Canvas is used to disseminate information to all students, and to allow students to pose questions, and more importantly, to answer each other&#39;s questions. Students are expected to log into the forum on a frequent basis to read messages and to engage in dialogue on the subject matter. The workload and pace of this subject will require students to exercise considerable diligence and to strive for efficient utilisation of class time and laboratory facilities. Accordingly, all computer activities which are not directly and expressly related to the curriculum are strictly prohibited in all networking labs.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The major topics covered in this subject are:  Network Access Ethernet Network Layer IP Addressing and Subnetting Transport Layer Application Layer Static Routing Dynamic Routing VLANs DHCP WLAN ACLs NAT for IPv4</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The primary source of information for this subject is the online course curriculum, accessible via Cisco Networking Academy web site (https://www.netacad.com/), which is referred to as &#39;NetAcad&#39;.

Furthermore, the subject attempts to develop in students appropriate theoretical and conceptual frames of reference and knowledge bases for the mastery of such practices.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject consists of weekly 3x hour sessions which are made up of lectures and in-class interactive discussions and debates. Students are expected to access the UTSOnline site for the subject to read indicated material, view online resources such as video clips, etc before the on-campus activities so that this time can be more effectively used for interactive problem solving and other collaborative activities.  Assessment tasks are work-based and are focused on assisting students to reflect on and improve their professional practice.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">1. Leadership: A Complex Role. The advent of a global knowledge economy, fuelled by technological innovation, has brought about political, social and economic transformation across the world. In particular, knowledge and social capital have become key resources and this has focused leadership attention on collaborative human creativity, entrepreneurial leadership practices, and organisational innovation as the key sources of competitive advantage. This topic explores the complex concept of leadership and its role in organizational and personal success. 2. Creating Purpose and Building Morale. The complexity of the global business environment calls for leadership that transcends the conventional role of &lsquo;management&#39; &ndash; leadership that is capable of articulating a compelling vision and of mobilizing the committed resources of all stakeholders. Through the co-creation of a meaningful Core (mission, vision and values) leaders focus the everyday behavior of stakeholders on &lsquo;what really matters&rsquo; with respect to mission accomplishment. 3. Aligning Organisational Structure with the Core. Realizing the Core of the organization requires leaders to scrutinize the appropriateness of the organizational structure or form with respect to addressing effectively the strategic challenges faced by the organization. This session explores structural options and matches these with the strategic intent of the organization. 4. Working with Culture and Mental Models. In a dynamic and challenging global context, organizational stakeholders need to exhibit flexibility and the capacity to learn and transform. This session explores the leadership practices around the cultural and personal behavioural transformation necessary to align stakeholder action with espoused strategy and purpose. 5. Leading Organisational Renewal. In complex, dynamic and highly competitive business environments, an important competitive advantage is the capacity of organizational stakeholders to manage relationships with others who have important resources but who belong to other organizations. The facilitation of the conditions under which knowledge, pertinent to the mission of the organization but not &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by its stakeholders, is acquired, constructed, distributed and transformed will be a vital aspect of leadership over the next decade. A key dimension of this session will be exploring leadership practices in contexts where the leader has no formal authority over those that s/he must influence.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There are no prescribed texts</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">49069</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Professional Practice and Leadership</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject develops an understanding of the role of engineering and technical managers as responsible leaders in organisations. It focuses on the need to work through other people, not only subordinates and supervisors, but other managers and leaders. The subject provides a comprehensive review of leadership theory by following the timeline of historical development. It teaches that there exist many complex facets of leadership and emphasises the belief that one should not accept a position of trust without accepting the responsibility that goes with it. However, the art of leadership cannot be learned solely from books, virtual cafes or YouTube videos, it needs to be experienced and practised by doing and by interacting with real humans. A central teaching element of this subject is a set of activities that require engagement, motivation, critical thinking, verbal communication, group participation, perseverance and performance under time pressure.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus This subject is also available in Hong Kong to offshore students only.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject uses a variety of teaching and learning activities. These activities consist of weekly face-to-face lectures and tutorials, individual assignments and a group project with discrete activities that facilitate individual assessment. The lectures are interactive and students are encouraged to actively participate in them by making comments and raising questions. Lecture notes will be made available either just before or during the lecture. Complementary material &ndash; e.g. readings, videos, exercises - will be made available both before and after lectures. The tutorial activities, project and presentations complement the theory and applications presented in the lectures and online material and represent a key component for realising the aims of the course. Students will be required to undertake one group project during this course. This project will involve a critical assessment and application of leadership and will require independent research, analysis and comment. Students will work in small teams &ndash; within larger groups - to complete the report and presentations required for the delivery of the project. They will be required to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration within the 49069 cohort and with other professionals in other fields. The primary goal of the tutorial activities is to work through the different facets of leadership from hands-on and reflective perspectives while being able to get feedback from the lecturer, the tutors and fellow students. The aim of this process, is to have students develop good understanding and confidence in contributing to purposeful leadership for the collaborative attainment of common goals. By scanning current media, students will also be required to analyse present problems in the wider community through the lens of leadership. This weekly exercise aims to emphasise the relevance and applicability of the concepts presented in this subject to current real-life situations. Because of its comprehensiveness, there will be only one project that will run the full extent of the semester.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42713</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Professional Practice and Leadership</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">3.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">32561</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Professional Practice and Leadership</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject explores a set of fundamental concepts and models relating to leading and managing change in the evolving knowledge economy.

Students should be able to: model problems in rigid body planar and spatial kinematics and rigid body planar dynamics; understand energy methods in contrast to direct applications of Newton's second law of motion for setting up a model; understand the physics of a problem formulated from a real mechanical system; appreciate the role of vibration in machines and structures in the engineering world; understand the procedures required to evaluate a vibration problem; and analyse the dynamic response of single-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems. The subject also covers the concept of a rigid body, full nomenclature used in kinematics, two-body velocity equations and velocity diagrams of planar motion; two-body acceleration equations and acceleration diagram; three-body velocity equations and acceleration equations including Coriolis acceleration term; angular velocity acceleration equations including three-dimensional problems; F=ma applied to a rigid-body-dynamics, significance of 'centre of mass', the 'moment' relationship (M=Ia, etc.); angular momentum, conservation of angular momentum (general case, centre of mass moving, no 'fixed' point); linear and angular impulse problems; energy methods for general planar motion; elementary principles of vibration theory, free vibration of undamped single-degree-of-freedom system; free decay vibration of damped single-degree-of-freedom system; and the forced vibration of single-degree-of-freedom system.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject uses a problem solving-based learning strategy that allows students to research and develop their own solutions to complex dynamics problems. All assessment tasks are problem-based and are designed to highlight the correct procedure for solving problems. Face-to-face class time occurs in two sessions; each session being two hours. For example: 2 hours of lecture and 2 hours of tutorial per week will be initiated throughout the session. Although there are relatively few principles of dynamics, they can only be truly mastered by studying and analysing problems. Relatively easy example problems are adopted for helping students in understanding the concepts, principles and procedures. Active interactions between the lecturer and students are carried out in the process of solving these problems. A few problems that are normally more difficult than the example problems are adopted in tutorials, in which the tutor and the students solve the questions together in order for the students to practice the procedure of these solutions. Students are expected to solve even more difficult problems in the assignments independently, thus to achieve a deeper understanding of all their previously and currently learned knowledge. Student learning is supported in the following way: 1. Prior to the lecture, the students are required to study the lecture notes, read the textbook and prepare to solve the example problems. In the lecture class, the lecturer will explain the concepts and principles, present their applications in real world, then demonstrate how to follow the procedure to solve the example problems. In each lecture, multiple-choice quizzes including 2 reading quizzes, 2 concept quizzes and 2 attention quizzes are used to prompt students&rsquo; understanding. Some questions can always be raised by both the lecturer and the students through the lecture and active interactions will be conducted. 2. Prior to tutorial, the students are required to make preparation for solving all tutorial problems. In each tutorial class, the students will form some small groups and are allowed some time to solve the selected tutorial problems. Discussions are highly encouraged. The tutor will always be available to answer questions and provide help in the process. Finally full solutions and detailed explanations are presented. 3. Four in-class quizzes are held in lecture for promoting the students&rsquo; learning and for the lecturer to understand the progress. Each in-class quiz consisting of one fundamental problem that is marked and then returned to the students in the next lecture where the solution will then be presented. Discussion and feedbacks are given for improvement. 4. Students are requested to complete five assignments independently throughout the process of learning the subject. Discussions among the students are highly encouraged. Each assignment consisting of four problems each must be submitted by the due date and two randomly selected problems are marked and returned to the students in this time. Discussion and feedbacks are given for improvement.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Revision on the kinematics of particles.

Most of the support material is available from a specific, interactive information tool (UTSOnline) and the internet.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is mediated entirely through an electronic environment. There will be NO classroom events, as all interaction will occur within the enabling confines of UTSOnline. This approach demonstrates to students the use of information tools through direct experience with a specific information tool (UTSOnline). The nature of information technology within Engineering is incredibly diverse. Whilst the underlying principles are very similar, the specific tools which might be used by an engineer will depend substantially upon their particular engineering discipline and/or the nature of their work (e.g. design versus project managament). Given this diversity, the subject relies on an approach which creates a general investigatory framework (driven primarily by the assessment tasks) and then requires students to take a substantial responsibility for exploring potential information tools and resources within this framework. The subject involves two types of work: individual and group. The individual work requires students to take on a consultant-like experience, in which a task is assigned and they must exercise self-motivation in exploring potential information sources. The group work also mimics real experience, and put students into a team for the purpose of short-term assignment, mirroring the role which they might have working within an organisation. This subject is run entirely online. There are no formal or information class sessions and aside from an subject introductory video, there are no videos of formal lectures nor any tutorials - although some instructional material may be posted on UTSOnline from time to time and the two online quizzes may contain vectors (links/URLs) to further informational/instructional material. You should ensure that you regularly login to the subject on UTSOnline and monitor announcements etc. This should be at least once a week, but preferably more often.

Students are expected to regularly check the CANVAS subject site. By their nature, most management practices are not rigid and managerial problems are not always solved by mathematical equations. The teaching and learning methods, together with the assessment items, are designed to allow students to reflect on the management topics covered in this subject, and encourage brainstorming and investigation. The fundamental approach to learning in this course can be summarised as follows:  Understand rather than memorise Take responsibility for your own learning Explore and test ideas, without limiting yourself to textbook situations Work collaboratively with others Above all, enjoy the experience  To achieve the objectives of this course, students are expected to prepare for the lecture through private study and participate in class discussions. A combination of weekly lecture presentations, discussions and assessment exercises are used to assist students in this endeavour. These methods introduce general management principles to students to enable them to critically reflect on how these principles are applied in real world examples. Students&rsquo; experiences and readings should be reflected through active contributions to class and/or online discussions to facilitate self and peer learning.

It consists of two components - a theoretical part and a practical part. The theoretical part is mostly reflected in the lecture classes and assessed in the final exam, while the practical part is mostly reflected in the lab classes and assessed using projects. The two components are equally important. The projects and labs/industrial visits are selected to reinforce the lecture topics. All students attend one lecture in a large group each week. Lectures cover the fundamentals only and should be used as a guide to more intensive self (or group) study. Students must follow the instruction given by the instructors to read the required textbook then practise the &ldquo;Review Questions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Multiple Choice Questions&rdquo; in each chapter covered by this subject. Presentation of the Subject: This subject is presented via three parallel activities: Lectures, Projects, Laboratory and Industrial Visits. The topics are focused on sections of the textbook. The projects and labs/industrial visits are selected to reinforce lecture topics. All students attend a once-weekly lecture. Groups of about 30 students attend a supervised project session, each of 1 hour duration per week. In the project sessions, the students will break up into teams of five students. Each project session will be followed by a 1 hour non-supervised session. Groups of 20 students attend two sessions at the Metrology Lab, each of 2 hours duration. Students will be divided into groups of 5 during each session to carry out activities currently being done in Certified Metrology Laboratories around the world. It is highly recommended that students watch and read the materials and watch the videos provided on UTSOnline, prior to attending the lab sessions, which will greatly aid in their assessment tasks and their learning experience. Workshop sessions and site visits are held as per program. Note the timetable, some days may have no formal activity. Students should pace their progress according to the above schedule. Laboratory requirements and other significant resource issues Machining of parts requires the use of all machine tools including the NC mill and all welding equipment in the Production Realization Lab. Other workshop equipment such as the workshop cranes may be used in the projects. All equipment in the Metrology Lab may be utilized.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is about the fundamentals of manufacturing. It covers the well-established equipment and materials shaping and forming processes used in manufacturing. Students gain an appreciation and understanding of materials processing principles and their importance to design and manufacturing engineering. They learn the classification of processes and examine the fundamentals of casting, forging, machining and fabrication together with other operations such as surface engineering and mechanical fastening. Students are introduced to engineering components and products, how they work, how they are made, their materials and why they are produced the way they are. The focus throughout the course is on the products that are designed and manufactured and the need to understand the capabilities and limitations of the various processes as well as their &ldquo;value adding&rdquo; nature in a competitive, quality conscious, technologically oriented society. The constraints of manufacturing in a globally competitive world whilst at the same time addressing occupational health and safety as well as environmental issues will be addressed in the subject.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Groover, M.P., Groover&#39;s Principles of Modern Manufacturing SI Version, Global Edition, Wiley (E-Book available from Wiley website) or Groover, M.P., Principles of Modern Manufacturing, 5th Ed.

It is essential for civil engineers to appreciate the variations and limitations of the performance of civil engineering materials. These materials are dictated by the structure-property relationships based on microstructural and molecular phase morphologies which in turn affect the macroscopic engineering properties, and especially their application to design and construction applications.
Topics covered include: engineering materials such as metals (including steel, aluminium, titanium), ceramic and glasses, polymers, composites and nanomaterials with a main focus on metals. This subject describes the material science principles required for a fundamental understanding of engineering materials and related processes, including in-service durability. After the basic physical and mechanical properties of these materials on both the microstructural and the structural scale are presented (encompassing composition of the materials, phase transformations and mechanical properties), the emphasis is on the performance of the materials in civil engineering design and construction applications. The concepts of material failure, including fracture, fatigue and creep, are introduced. The corrosion and degradation of materials exposed to environmental conditions are presented. There is a strong emphasis on relating the materials science principles to applications of interest in civil and environmental engineering, thereby illustrating the importance of fundamental theoretical knowledge in everyday processes and applications. The manufacturing and engineering application of selected construction materials, including steel, aluminium, concrete and bricks, is introduced and integrated with the fundamental concepts described above.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48364</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Civil and Environmental Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Construction materials used by engineers, independent of their disciplines, vary significantly in their compositions, properties and service performance. Failure of these materials to function effectively in service conditions may lead to extensive damage to components, equipment and structures. In many cases, with the failure of the materials, public safety is also affected. It is important for the engineers to have sound knowledge on the construction materials used in relation to their specification, testing methods, analysis and interpretation of test results. Material testing experience is needed to familiarise test methods and the use of modern equipment. In addition, it provides a practical understanding of design concepts such as stress, strain, strength, stiffness, failure, durability, etc. This subject provides an in-depth knowledge and understanding of test methods for civil engineering materials and recognises the applications and limitation of the testing techniques. This subject is designed to provide opportunity to understand a variety of testing techniques used to evaluate the properties of materials. Techniques include destructive testing, non-destructive testing, durability testing, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy, etc. Principles of the techniques, data analysis and applications of the techniques to engineering problems such as failure analysis and phase transformations are studied. After successfully completing this subject, students are able to: (i) discuss the principles of a variety of standard and non-standard testing techniques used to assess materials; (ii) explain the applications and limitations of these techniques; (iii) demonstrate a basic level of proficiency in the use of selected testing methods; (iv) select appropriate techniques to assess engineering materials or investigate problems; and (v) present the test results confidently and in a professional manner.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">48600</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject is the first in a set of three engineering design subjects.

Students are organised into teams and work on an engineering project which they complete throughout the session whilst applying the design principles that are taught. Students are required to control the shape of their project, work with the project stakeholders, set project deliverables and see the project through to completion. Learning material is provided to students via UTSOnline in the form of weekly modules. These modules contain the subject content and is delivered in a manner that follows their expected progress in their project. Students are expected to complete the relevant online learning modules before attending weekly classes. This involves: reviewing video course material, reading provided materials, performing online quizzes. Students are expected to attend the classes held every teaching week. Classes consist of collaborative learning activities related to the online teaching material provided in that week. These activities include: class exercises, group discussions (both amongst your team and with other students/teams), role play, and collaborative in-class quizzes. At two stages during the session a &ldquo;design review&rdquo; is held where students present their project progress to date. Teams present their work to be reviewed by the teaching staff. These design reviews are used to assess and provide timely feedback regarding the progress of the students&#39; project such that students are able to act upon received feedback to improve the outcomes of their projects. Peer review is incorporated throughout the subject. Each week students prepare a weekly progress report which are shared across the class allowing students to compare their progress. Final presentations include a peer-review component with students not only presenting their work but also critiquing the outcomes of other students. Although project work is performed in teams, grades are scaled individually using SPARK+.

These classes will consist of a 1 hour lecture followed by a 2 hour lab. Students are expected to study weekly videos and readings on UTSOnline before attending class, which will form the basis of class discussions and exercises. In the lecture, the weekly topic is discussed and students are invited to ask questions to further their understanding. In the lab, students work on a programming exercise together with other students. In this activity, students will not only apply the techniques that they have learnt from the videos, readings and lectures, but will also research and apply new techniques from the Internet as needed. In the labs, students will also do regular peer reviews and assessments of each other&#39;s work. The peer review sessions allow students to learn new techniques from each other, and they also help students to develop a more critical eye for quality code. With the exception of the week 7 mid-session test and the week 12 final project demos, the remaining classes will each consist of a 3 hour lab supporting the students&#39; development of their final Android projects. In class, students will work on their individual applications and are encouraged to ask the instructor for feedback and also for help with any technical issues. Although students will work individually on different ideas of their own choosing, students will also be expected to share with their peers any useful new programming techniques that they have discovered through their research. These classes are an opportunity to learn new techniques from other students as well as from the instructor. Outside of class, students are also encouraged to share new programming techniques on the UTSOnline discussion board. Each week, students will be required to show the instructor the progress they have made during the week, and it is expected that students come to class prepared with specific questions to ask about their projects. Classes will run in the collaborative pod classrooms to facilitate communication and interaction between students while working on the exercises and projects.

Students will have extensive interactive activities in class and using UTSOnline, with both their fellow students and teachers. The subject includes two stages of learning activities: six weeks of theory and five weeks of project develpoment. In the theory stage, students will learn the basic knowledge of different wireless networks, through a mix of online lectures, interactive discussions, online quizzes, forum discussions, exercises and group discussions. Students are required to watch online lectures and study the supplemental reading materials before the class. The tutorial class is built upon such pre-class preparation by assuming students&rsquo; familiarity with the content. What a student can learn and achieve in the tutorial classes largely depends on how well he/she has prepared, and how well he/she accepts feedback. In each tutorial, a quick review of the online lecture and Q&amp;A session will be firstly provided. Students will then work on some exercises. Each exercise will be discussed and reference answers will be provided to students. Students will then have group discussions for some small projects/topics in flexible forms such as discussions, debating, and performing. Finally, an online quiz will be conducted. Tutors will provide oral feedback immediately following each quiz on a weekly basis. In the project development stage, students will work in groups to develop innovative solutions for practical applications, using the wireless technologies learned in the theory stage. In this stage, students will be able to not only get a deeper understanding of wireless network technologies, but also learn the skills of applying technologies to solve practical problems in a collaborative and competitive way, mimicking the real working environment. Feedback will be provided both orally and in writing over the whole period, from both tutors and student peers. Tutorials will be organized into different themes, including cooperation, competition and commercialization across three weeks. Students will play the different roles of collaborator, competitor and investor during this process, and will help each other to improve project work and peer-assess the quality of the work. Outstanding groups have the opportunity of being invited and funded to continue their project work as either their thesis or internship project. Across the whole subject period, students are strongly encouraged to participate in the active learning exercises in class. Merit will be given according to the level of engagement demonstrated by each student.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction and Wireless data transmission principles.

The IT-business alignment has been the major challenge as organisations go through the transformation that keeps them competitive and agile. Employing successful enterprise architecture ensures that changes to the business process are correctly supported by information systems and their underlying IT infrastructure. This undergraduate subject introduces ways in which information systems can support business networking, focusing on sharing information and integrating business activities with business partners. Students learn enterprise architecture methodologies and gain an understanding of the tools and techniques for the design of business. Through case studies, this subject reinforces material provided in lectures and tutorials, and additional research while giving students scope to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking and organisational skills. The subject stresses the development and assessment of real-world experience through applied and innovative tasks and with the team effort. Students develop the knowledge and skills required for using and managing information within an organisation.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject will be taught by a combination of lectures (1.5 hours) and Tutorials (1.5 hours), individual and group work. It is a Faculty guideline that a 6-credit point subject requires a 9-hour weekly study load, which includes attending lectures and tutorials. This subject involves 3 hours of lectures and tutorials plus 6 hours of study outside class (which includes both individual and team work). Students are strongly advised to consider this workload when planning their academic effort this session. Student learning is facilitated by a combination of face-to-face and online learning. Students are expected to undertake pre-work before each weekly session, which is available in UTSOnline. This involves reading selected textbook chapters, research articles, and watching Lynda.com courses related to the topic covered in lectures and tutorials. This is followed by a discussion during the tutorial. Students are required to complete all assessment tasks through in-class/tutorial activities: group work on a given case study during the tutorial sessions and out of class activities: UTSOnline discussion board and self-directed learning using Internet/handouts/workbook. The lectures contain a collection of specifically focused collaborative in-class activities and exercises. In tutorials, students engage in small group discussions and are required to provide the answers to the assigned case study. These discussions draw out key issues of the topic. Group findings are presented to the class with a view to consolidate and summarize the information. Each week these provide students with verbal feedback from their tutors, to gauge their progress and gain ideas for future direction. Face-to-face teaching in lectures/tutorials and students access of UTSOnline to view videos, reference materials, and communication tools help them to prepare and develop their individual and group work assessment tasks. Verbal feedback is integral to each tutorial collaborative activity. Tutor feedback during tutorials will support students to draft a report, and written feedback on the final report is also provided. All tutorial sessions and lectures are designed to help students to prepare for the final exam. The teaching and learning strategies in this subject support the UTS model of learning: 1) An integrated exposure to professional practice through dynamic and multifaceted modes of practice-oriented education; 2) Professional practice situated in a global workplace, with international mobility and international and cultural engagement as centrepiece; 3) Learning which is research-inspired and integrated, providing academic rigour with cutting edge technology to equip graduates for life-long learning. Real world problems and case studies will be discussed and students need to provide critical and relevant solutions. These approaches aim at preparing students to become more autonomous, involved and responsible for their own learning.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject primarily covers the following topics:  Enterprise Architecture Frameworks and Principles Modeling Enterprise Architectures with TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) The Architecture Development Method (ADM) Delivering Enterprise Architecture with ArchiMate Cloud Computing for Enterprise Architectures Governance of the Information Systems Organization</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Resources required to support teaching and learning in this subject will be made available on UTSOnline and updated throughout the session.</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">31950</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Information, Systems and Modelling</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject describes the evolution of systems towards distributed business environments with an emphasis on processes that require people to work together over distance.

This is a hands-on subject where students are given integrated exposure to professional practice. These areas include identification and control of dynamic systems, neural networks and fuzzy systems can be implemented as model-free estimators and/or controllers. As trainable dynamic systems, these intelligent control systems can learn from experience with numerical and linguistic sample data. As an example, students will develop an expertise in biomedical, pattern recognition, control system using neural networks and fuzzy logic.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There are three modules in this subject: background to neural networks and fuzzy logic, intelligent systems and advanced applications. As this is a hands-on real-world practice oriented subject, active learning opportunities are integrated into the class. There will be 10 sessions of lectures, 8 sessions of tutorials/project discussion and 2 project presentations. For this Project work, students are required to apply neural network, convolutional deep neural network or fuzzy logic for the identification or control of one practical project. Each project may include the development of a computer software system (e.g. a hand written character recognition system, or a fingerprint recognition system), a control system (e.g. a ball and beam system) or a biomedical system (e.g. wheelchair control, medical imaging, EMG finger movements). The subject is organised so that students collaborate from week 1 with a maximum of 3 students in a team. They select a joint project within the provided framework and will research and work together for the duration of the subject. Students will present as a group yet submit individual research papers with their interpretations and explanations. Designated weekly UTSOnline information is to be accessed prior to class. Lectures, tutorials and laboratories are used to discuss this information, to answer any questions and to provide support and ongoing feedback.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The first module concerns fundamental concepts of artificial neural systems and fuzzy logic theory. It introduces the foundations of neural network learning rules including the Hebbian, Perceptron, Delta, and Widrow-Hoff learning rules. It includes fuzzy sets, linguistic variables and approximate reasoning. The second module covers the concept of error function minimisation using the steepest descent minimisation technique. This is also extended to multilayer feedforward neural networks. Other concepts such as generalised delta learning rule, feedforward recall and error back-propagation training, associative memories, matching and self-organising networks will also be discussed. In this module, the preliminaries and basic construction of a fuzzy controller will be discussed. An adaptive fuzzy logic controller, the self-organising fuzzy logic controller will also be discussed. In advanced level, a basic concept of convolutional neural network and genetic algorithm are introduced. The third module relates to advanced applications of intelligent systems. The design and development of a semi-autonomous wheelchair using neural network classifications will be discussed. Other advanced applications relate to the control of blood glucose in patients with diabetes using a fuzzy system.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Ling S, &quot;Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic&quot;, UTS, 2019</Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">49141</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Civil and Environmental Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject consists of two separate components.

Part of the knowledge gained by students in this subject is a further understanding of PSC behaviour and competence in PSC design so that the appropriate use of this structural material can be made in decisions on future structural designs. This subject is intended to build on their knowledge of the fundamentals of PSC behaviour aspects of design of simply supported beams (uncracked and cracked section behaviour under linear elastic conditions, equivalent loads and load balancing techniques, ultimate moment capacity of rectangular PSC beams) to encompass the major items in prestressed (post-tensioned) concrete design. The main topics are the analysis and design of continuous (statically indeterminate) PSC beams and of PSC flat slab systems. Other topics include the analysis and design of PSC tension members, a more detailed consideration and estimation of losses in PSC members and anchorage and end-block reinforcement design. The design is in accordance with the requirements of the current edition of AS3600 Concrete Structures.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Prestressed concrete design focuses on:  theoretical material; its application to professional and construction practice in structural design; and lectures supplemented by notes, worked examples and practice problems.

Examples of peer learning activities include quizzes posted on UTSOnline for students to solve and complete in and out of class and discussion board questions posted on UTSOnline for students and teaching staff to solve and answer out of class. Students are expected to read the indicated material and answer the associated online questions before the class so that the instructor can focus on using this pre-reading information on problem solving activities in small groups and discuss any problematic material. The lecture material explains problematic soil and associated problems while discussing various methods for ground improvement and application of different design approaches through a variety of means. These will include the preparation of small written reports, the completion of a self-learning module and problem solving assignments. Where feasible, assignments are designed to encourage the students to work with a wide range of data inputs and to apply innovative thought. Feedback is provided early on in class activities and online feedback quizzes. The class sessions provide a collaborative learning experience. Past examination questions will be posted on UTSOnline in the form of tutorial examples, quizzes, and assignments. Students are required to attempt the specified questions before coming to class. During the class session, students will communicate with each other and the instructor to solve the questions. Students will be expected to consult with each other to confirm the worked solutions they have obtained. The class sessions will consist mainly of problem-solving and discussion. Students are expected to attempt the tutorial questions before their scheduled class. At the completion of the class sessions, students will be expected to complete further examination questions and submit these as assignments and receive feedback. Please note that although the quizzes do not directly count towards assessment for the subject, assignments will be marked and considered in the overall assessment of the subject. A research-inspired learning strategy is adopted in this subject for group activities, including the major research project. To motivate students to learn disciplinary research skills, research inspired assessment tasks are adopted. Different research projects are allocated to groups of students after meeting with them face-to-face. Students will form themselves in small groups and can directly connect the defined research projects to one or some of the sessions. On weekly basis students will be enabled to work together on their research project until completion. Constructive feedback on the progress of the project will be given early on; therefore students can address the comments in their final submissions. Students are encouraged to use the new collaborative spaces available at UTS to facilitate the required collaborative group work for planning and presenting the major research project.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject covers the following content areas:  Introduction to problematic soils and ground improvement methods Classification of soft soils, the associated problems, and required site investigation Design and construction methods of above ground improvement techniques including compaction, preloading, reinforcement using geotextiles and stabilising berms Design and construction methods of flexible inclusions for ground improvement such as preloading with vertical drains and vacuums, electro osmosis and biotechnical stabilisation.

The flipped lecture format allows the students to engage with the learning material in an asynchronous, self-paced, location-independent manner. It also supports a modular approach to delivering core content, permitting students to revise, engage and re-engage as suits their needs. Included in the learning material are staged practice exercises to help the students develop their knowledge and skills in a consequence- and stress-free environment. In the workshops, this learning will be reinforced with scaffolded exercises that weave the core material together and provide a practical experience of the subject matter. These exercises are then capped with a low-stakes assessment task to help the students gauge their progress and understanding of the material. Tying these two structural components together is the weekly drop-in sessions, that offer students a face-to-face expert contact point tailored to their current progress, addressing the exact difficulties they are facing at the time.

The subject is taught progressively. The assessments are available progressively so that students can learn at their own pace. Note: Students are expected to commit additional study time outside of class time. The university regards this subject as requiring 5-8 hours of study per week, in addition to the four hours of online class time. This subject is designed so that students can move through the course at a speed commensurate with the student&rsquo;s ability and/or other demands upon the student&#39;s time, such as assessment deadlines in other subjects, paid-work, family commitments, and illness. All assessment items form part of a sequence. A student may only attempt a new assessment item after passing the preceding assessment item in the sequence. This is the reason why a student does not receive marks for a later assessment item when the student has not completed an earlier assessment item. The enforcement of a sequence of assessments also better utilises the tutoring resources; when a tutor helps a student with a particular assessment item, the tutor can safely assume that a student has completed the prerequisite material. Also, feedback on earlier assessments helps the students improve and deepen their knowledge in order to attempt and prepare for later assessment items.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">1.

This subject familiarises students with approaches to design and implement code that is modular, re-usable, reliable and maintainable. Working on an individual project that requires the design and implementation of part of a mechatronic system allows students to apply their knowledge to a real-life problem. Topics include: objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, run-time instantiation, threading, thread communication, event handling, error handling, use of generic features of C++ such as the STL and utilising APIs, documentation and testing.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus Spring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject uses a model of brief interactive lectures followed by class activities to support student learning. The students are expected to go through online materials and videos before coming to class as instructed in the program so they are prepared for class activities. These activities include collaborative discussions, problem solving and hands on activities. Students will be guided and assisted to reach learning objectives through a series of milestones with deliverables strategically set throughout the session. A code peer review mechanism enables students to gain a wider appreciation of applying theoretical knowledge on given tasks and the merits of appropriate technical solutions. During the first part of the session, students build and practice fundamental object-oriented C++ skills. In the second half of the session, using the tool ROS (Robot Operating System) in Linux, students apply these skills to an individual project. Students undertake an individual project (sensing in robots) that reinforces the theoretical content and culminates in a formal submission of code and appropriate documentation for evaluation.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The following topics will be covered: &bull; The Objected Orientated Paradigm: objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism &bull; Basics of initialization and memory handling: compile time / run-time initialisation, heap and stack &bull; Basics of multi-threading, cross thread communication and error handling: synchronizing threads, sharing data across threads, mutexes/semaphores, exclusive locking, asynchronous events &bull;The use of generic features of C++ such as the STL containers and data structures, selection of appropriate structures for effective programming &bull; Basics of libraries, using APIs demonstrated on state of the art Open Source Software. Designing, Developing and Documenting an API. &bull; Basics of the Component Based Software Engineering approach, with the Robotics Operating System (ROS) as an example &bull; Basics of utilisng code automation and auto documentation generation tools (CMake and Doxygen) Each of these topics addresses an important aspect in programming modern Mechatronics systems. The intention is that, as you work your way through the subject, your learning will be cumulative. That is, the content you cover in one section should directly help you to understand the topics that follow. For each of the above topics, a separate list of sub-topics and weekly learning schedule is given in the Program. The students&#39; existing knowledge of sensor and control, combined with activities to understand and appreciate the object oriented paradigm is leveraged to complete a final individual project.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">31748</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Computer Science</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Undergraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject introduces students to the specifics of the World Wide Web (WWW) and internet-based programming.

A sound quality management system, based on modern and up-to-date quality planning and analysis tools and techniques, reduces rejects, warranty claims and the need for costly rework. It helps to preserve customer goodwill and builds a brand loyalty based on objective criteria rather than illusions.
Topics covered in this subject include:

 quality and its modern definition
 analysis of customer needs and customer satisfaction
 integrating quality into design of products and services
 managing supplier relations and quality of supplies
 monitoring and statistical analysis of process quality, and

For this to happen a system must be available when required and be able to be used reliably, consistent with operational needs. This subject explores the concepts of Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM), and the relationships between them. RAM directly affect the effectiveness of a system.
The approach taken to understanding the concepts include a treatment of each of the factors separately, together with a consideration of the relationships between them, so that a systemic view of RAM is obtained.

It is not a conventional subject guided by a set curriculum. Its purpose is to provide an environment in which students can gain and simultaneously translate knowledge into a robotics system. Studios are product-based subjects, largely conducted in the studio, in collaboration with other students, academic staff and industry mentors. Students do a combination of individual self-directed study and project work. This is the first studio in the fundamentals stage of the Robotics Engineering major. The major has three studios situated in the following stages: fundamentals; applications; and professional. The stages of the projects are the means by which students learn how to apply their knowledge to what they can achieve. The stages follow the classic engineering paradigm of assess, design and implement. The objective of this studio is to introduce students to the multidisciplinary field of robotics engineering in both theory and practice. It aims to familiarise students with the robotics topics of mathematics, hardware and software, control and planning, sensing and perception motivated by real-world applications. Individual tasks in this studio are guided by a learning contract established at the beginning of the session. What differentiates the applications studio from the fundamentals studio is the expectation of the level of proficiency of students. Once students have completed the fundamentals and applications studios and a range of coursework subjects, it is expected that they have the skills and knowledge to allow them to undertake the development of more challenging products in the final studio.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spring session, City campus Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The Robotics Studio provides technical rationale and application in the first part of the semester. In the second part of the semester, students apply their understanding to product development. In the first five weeks of the studio students are provided an opportunity to review and expand their fundamental knowledge through a combination of online content and in-class activities. Students are expected to have completed pre-class activities, such as watching lecture videos / running provided simulations and completing programming challenges, so that they are well prepared for the in-class activities that reinforce these concepts through a series of collaborative problem solving exercises. Students demonstrate that they have developed the required understanding of these basic competencies on an individual level through a series of quizzes. Quizzes are practical hands-on activities, and require completion of portions of code to achieve certain expected basic functions, submission of quizzes is via GIT and/or UTS online. The quizzes inform level of understanding to prepare for product development. Individual student feedback from staff is provided on each quiz and during formation of the ILC. Students formalise the product development carried out in the studio through an individual learning contract (ILC). The product must demonstrate application of the programming, sensing and control competencies. The ILC is developed in collaboration with subject coordinator, who acts as a stakeholder as well as a mentor. The ILC needs to stipulate the iterative product development lifecycle and application of agile methodologies. As part of iterative process students have the opportunity to revisit the ILC during the session if required. Student progress is demonstrated through the Personal Design Journal which is audited weekly, code sprints with in-class demonstration and the peer teaching activity. Staff and peer feedback are provided during in-class demonstration of code sprint and the peer teaching activity. The final product will be demonstrated in class. Studio learning is a shared learning opportunity; collectively we are responsible for translating fundamental robotic competencies, programming, sensing and control, to the process of product development. Assistance is readily provided in-class while online collaborative platform Slack is leveraged for ongoing support. Students are especially encouraged to leverage the digital space to collaboratively exchange ideas and share technical insights.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The following topics will be covered: Robotic maths  2D transforms basic filtering basic probability  Software and hardware  Basic C++ in ROS (in Linux) basic Matlab basic designs version control documentation (doxygen, wiki)  Planning and Control  Basic planning 2D low level control  Sensing and Perception  Laser range finder (modeling, noise) 2D basic mapping basic localization  Basic research project skills</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">42044</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">C04271 Master of Engineering/C04273 Master of Engineering Master of Engineering Management/C04277 Master of Engineering (Extension)/MAJ03531 Robotics C04278 Master of Engineering (Advanced)/MAJ03532 Robotics C04309 Master of Professional Engineering/MAJ03533 Robotics</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">12.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Postgraduate</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The objective of this subject is to further advance students learning to an intermediate level in the multidisciplinary field of robotics engineering in both theory and practice.

Learning materials such as online content and videos will be provided before each class, so students have the basic knowledge to undertake in-class activities. During the class, students will work collaboratively with teaching staff to solve specific robotic problems and, the required code templates and guidance will be provided. Students will have the opportunity to test and showcase their solutions in simulated environments as well in real robotic hardware. The progress of the students learning will be assessed by a series of practical tests, where students are required to demonstrate, answer questions and/or submit their codebase to a repository or via Canvas for evaluation. Individual feedback will be provided on their performance and areas that need improvements will be identified and incorporated in each student&rsquo;s Individual Learning Contracts (ILC). Students will personalise their learning experience and methods by forming an ILC with a focus on system development and delivery. The robotic system must solve a real-world problem and should demonstrate competencies in programing, perception and planning. The teaching staff will support students in the ILC preparation process by helping students to identify a project and learning goals. From week 7, students will be provided with in-class project support where they can collaborate with other students and teaching staff to solve any problem that they face during the system development phase. Students need to demonstrate their progress through the Personal Design Journal, which will be continuously monitored to ensure timely completion of the product development. In week 9 student will showcase their progress of individual projects in the class. This will allow students to identify areas where limited progress has been made and fix it.

The derivation of models from real-world devices through measurement and the comparison of model predictions with experimental results is emphasised in the laboratory component of the course. A group project that requires the design and implementation of part of a control/communication system allows students to apply their knowledge to a real-life problem. Topics include signal types and their representation in the time and frequency domains; modelling systems with differential or difference equations and transforms of the equations; signal operations and processing; the relationship between discrete and continuous quantities and the mathematical techniques applicable to each; the effects of feedback; time and frequency domain performance of systems; system stability; and control design techniques and simple communication systems. Through learning activities students also gain study skills, including academic literacy skills, and an appreciation of the different fields of practice of engineering and the interdisciplinary nature of engineering. Class time is used for lectures, tutorials, laboratories and project work. There are a number of formal laboratory sessions that apply control and communication theory, which also familiarise students with the laboratory equipment.

There are a number of formal laboratory sessions that familiarise students with the laboratory equipment. Students then undertake a substantial group project that reinforces the theoretical content and culminates in a formal written presentation of their work. Face-to-face class time occurs in two 2 hour sessions per week. The first 2 hour session is used to conduct classroom activities, such as collaborative problem solving. The second 2 hour session is used to conduct hands-on activities in either a computer lab or the Signals Lab. Student learning is supported in the following way: 1. Prior to each classroom session, students will be required to study the Notes and associated readings and prepare questions relating to the weekly content and the assesment tasks they are working on. 2. At the beginning of the classroom session, academic staff will discuss with the entire group the challenges they are facing. Students faced with similar challenges will be prompted to come together to facilitate collaborative discussions and work on tutorial exercises in a group setting. 3. Prior to each lab session, students will be required to complete pre-lab work. 4. In the lab session, students will work in groups of 2 on their tasks. Academic staff are available in each lab to review work and provide immediate feedback. 5. For the final project, lab time will be used for one-on-one consultations on particular aspects of a student&#39;s work.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The content covered is divided into the following sections:   Signals and Systems in the Time-Domain   Signals and Systems in the Frequency-Domain   Transfer Functions   Discrete-Time Systems   Control Systems   State-Variables   Design Project   Each of these sections addresses an important aspect in modern systems. The intention is that, as you work your way through the subject, your learning will be cumulative. That is, the content you cover in one section should directly help you to understand the topics that follow. A weekly learning schedule, based on a recommended study sequence of the sections, is given in the Study Guide. For each of the above sections, a separate list of topics, exercise problems and suggested reading is also provided in the Study Guide. Below is a brief summary of the content that is later covered in detail in the Notes. Prerequisite knowledge You are expected to have successfully completed introductory subjects in Mathematics and Circuit Analysis. Specifically, you should be able to analyse a second-order circuit using differential equations, phasors and Laplace transforms, as well as simulating the response using MATLAB&reg;. Section 1 &ndash; Signals and Systems in the Time-Domain Most signals are shown to be made up of a small set of simple signals, which are formalised and categorised. The importance of the sinusoid is emphasised and the phasor definition is given new meaning by introducing the concept of negative frequency. Linear systems are described by their differential equations. The solution of a first-order system for an arbitrary input is shown to lead to the convolution integral &ndash; an alternative way to describe a system. Section 2 &ndash; Signals and Systems in the Frequency-Domain The orthogonal properties of the sinusoid are used to build a &ldquo;frequency-domain&rdquo; picture of signals. Periodic signals are shown to consist of a set of harmonically related sinusoids &ndash; the Fourier Series and the concept of a spectrum are thus introduced. The spectrum sheds new light on the behaviour of systems, especially those naturally considered to operate in the frequency-domain, such as filters. The concept of the Fourier Series is extended to almost any arbitrary signal by introducing the Fourier Transform. The concept of a system&rsquo;s frequency response operating on a signal&rsquo;s spectrum to produce a new output spectrum is introduced. The complementary operations of sampling and reconstruction; and modulation and demodulation; are introduced as important underlying concepts of modern communication and signal processing systems. Section 3 &ndash; Transfer Functions The Laplace Transform and the concept of the s-domain and transfer functions is developed as a generalisation of Fourier analysis. It is then shown how all linear systems can be analysed for nearly any input in the s-domain. This leads to a simple description of systems in terms of blocks containing transfer functions. The concept of stability of a system is introduced, as well as the nature of step responses and sinusoidal responses of systems. The frequency response is revisited but in terms of synthesis using Bode plots rather than analysis. The time-domain response of the step-input of a system is analysed and performance measures of a system&rsquo;s step-response are introduced. Feedback &ndash; the cornerstone of modern control theory &ndash; is introduced and some of the advantages of feedback are examined. Section 4 &ndash; Discrete-Time Systems Modern systems use digital signal processing and are therefore inherently discrete-time systems. The analysis of such systems in the frequency-domain leads to the z-transform &ndash; which has a correspondence with the Laplace Transform. The properties of the z-transform are introduced, and simple systems and signals analysed in the z-domain. Discretization of signals, and reconstructing them back into the continuous-time domain is a basic operation of digital signal processing systems. The effects of this operation are examined. The discretization of systems is also looked at from the point of view of matching in the frequency-domain and time-domain. Section 5 &ndash; Control Systems Automatic control systems are a fact of modern life. This section looks at how control systems are specified and designed. It introduces the concept of designing with poles and zeros, and shows the utility of the root locus method. The effect of system discretization, used in a digital implementation of a control system, is examined briefly. Section 6 &ndash; State-Variables The idea of representing a system in terms of only input and output behaviour is challenged by the method of state-variables, which attempts to encapsulate the internal time-domain behaviour of a system. It&rsquo;s power as an analysis and design method becomes evident when it is shown how initial conditions and multiple inputs and outputs are easily handled by state-variables. The set of state equations which describe a system are solved in both continuous-time and discrete-time, and it is shown how the solution can be easily applied to high-order systems. State-variable feedback is introduced. Section 7 &ndash; Design Project This section brings all the other sections together in a project that requires the analysis and design of a communication scheme and a control scheme. You will be required to interpret specifications for each scheme and come up with sound engineering designs using a variety of methods. The designs will be simulated and then experimentally verified.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lathi, B.P., Linear Systems and Signals, 2nd Ed., Oxford University Press, 2005.

The teaching and learning approach is based on learning by doing collaborative work in small teams. Students are expected to attend initial subject induction session and weekly workshops (tutorials and labs). The workshops will give you an opportunity to apply the material and build a working relationship among other team members in a collaborative group learning environment. The collaborative group learning will require students to play different professional roles (e.g. product owner, project manager, business analyst, developer, tester) and work with other students in small groups on workshop case study project excercises and their own team project. Students are expected to attend all the workshops for this subject and must do research, reading and test (watch any relevant videos, if available) about the upcoming topic before coming into the weekly workshop session. You will unable to understand and perform collaborative in class workshop tasks and quiz if you do not prepare in advance. Students are expected to extend their learning beyond the classroom, by researching material to support the project requirements.The ability to work in project teams is an important attribute for Engineering and IT professionals. The team project provides students with practice in applying the knowledge and skills of software engineering to a real world problem.Communication and presentation skills will be practiced as part of the project deliverables. Students are required to bring their work in progress project deliverables to workshop sessions for face-to-face weekly feedback from their workshop tutors or coaches before formal submission. This will enable the students to identify and correct any issues before formal submission, and consequenlty improve their learning and performance in the subject. Students must not think that the slides will provide them with all they need to know about the topic, and they do not need to attend workshops. The slides highlight only the main points about the topic and are not a substitute for explanation, application and discussion, which is done in the workshop sessions. This is a practical subject and the focus will be on &quot;How&quot; and not on &quot;What&quot;.

This subject provides a learning environment similar to further workplace.  Students will work as software engineers and learn experience by doing what they do. In small self-managed teams, students will leverage agile project planning and programming skills to execute a proof of concept, prototype, problem solve and/or minimum viable product. Teams are aided and guided by mentors (tutors, industry partners and academic researchers). To encourage high technical standards and peer learning, all teams develop the software based on specified requirements but are free to decide how those requirements can be implemented to achieve greater satisfaction(s) or fit users&rsquo; need(s).  Students are expected to document progress, reflection and design thinking regarding their software engineering experience ahead of the weekly meeting. The team must have at least one meeting every week to review the project scope, progress, achievements and hazards. Students are expected to demonstrate their engagement as well as communication skills during the teamwork and weekly meetings. Students are also expected to use the outside of SES class time to work with their team members. Lecturers, tutors and mentors will provide feedback regarding student achievements, results of meeting, design thinking, teamwork and hazards in the workshops. Formal assessments of the project achievements and deliverables occur at the middle and end of the semester. The lecturers, mentors, tutors and peers will all involve in the formal assessment and provide the feedback through online system and workshops.

The subject concludes with a detailed study of the problems of soil settlement and soil shear strength. Geology practicals and soil laboratory sessions allow students to gain deeper insight into the soil behaviour through hands-on civil/geotechnical engineering interpretation and experience. In addition, the research project/case study and debate activity enable students to gain research skills. At successful completion of this subject, students communicate effectively with civil and geotechnical engineers as well as engineering geologists for real design and construction projects. In addition, students are able to Identify, interpret and analyse geotechnical data obtained from the field or laboratory for infrastructure and building design and construction projects, contributing to the subject and course graduate attributes. At the completion of this subject students should: be familiar with the natural processes occurring on the surface of the earth; be able to communicate with geologists, earth scientists and others involved in studying the ground; understand the fundamentals of the behaviour of soil as an engineering material; be aware of those aspects of soil behaviour which have a significant environmental impact; be able to solve a range of soil-related problems, especially those involving water flow and soil settlement; and have a solid basis for further formal study and self-study in the geotechnical area.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campusSpring session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Learning and teaching strategies include research inspired, practice based and collaborative learning approaches and include Lecture Material (online content), Lecture Sessions (in class and online content), Tutorial Sessions (in class and online content), Geology Practical Sessions (in class and online content), and Soil Laboratory Sessions (in laboratory and online content). Students will carry out hands-on soil tests in the laboratory to obtain the physical and mechanical properties of different soils. On arrival to the laboratory, students must be ready to do the tests. Hence, students are expected to read the laboratory handbook (available on UTSOnline) before coming to class and prepare a question related to test setup or results interpretation. During laboratory time students will work collaboratively in teams using pre-reading material, and taking photos, filming the practical session and taking notes are encouraged. Students are also required to familiarise themselves with the key learning outcomes that are listed in the laboratory handbook for each laboratory session. At the completion of each laboratory session, students will be expected to write up their own laboratory report addressing the laboratory handbook requirements, learning criteria and key learning outcomes. The course consists of two components, Soil Mechanics and Geology. Lectures are supported by an online handbook which contains lecture summaries and readings. Students will gain most from the lectures if they read each week&#39;s material in advance. Instructors will further discuss the online pre-lecture/tutorial materials and activities in the class and build further on those through practical examples and case studies. Students should expect to spend on average 6.5 hours per week on this subject in addition to actively participating in all the tutorials, practical sessions, laboratories and lectures. A collaborative learning experience is provided in the practical/tutorial/laboratory sessions. In the geology practical sessions, students will form small groups and collect coded rock and mineral samples from the available bank of rocks and minerals, and then see if they can identify the samples through discussion and the tips provided in the lecturer/tutorial content (in class and online content) and comments made by the instructors in the class or in the online discussion board. Past examination questions will be posted on UTSOnline in the form of tutorial examples, quizzes, and assignments. Students are required to attempt the specified questions and read the indicated material (available on UTSOnline) before coming to class and prepare a minute paper or question for discussion in the class. During the class session, students will communicate with each other and the instructor to solve the questions. Students will be expected to consult with each other to confirm the worked solutions they have obtained to the tutorial questions. Students are expected to be punctual and regular when attending the face-to-face sessions in this subject. At the completion of the tutorial sessions, students will be expected to complete further examination questions, and submit them as assignments, and receive feedback as per Assessment Feedback section. A research-inspired learning strategy is adopted in this subject for the group and individual activities, including geology practicals, the research project and debating activity. To motivate students to learn disciplinary research skills, research inspired assessment tasks are adopted in many parts of the subject development. As an example, different research projects are allocated to students after meeting with them face-to-face. In addition, debating sessions will be oragnised in tutorial/lecture classes and during these sessions, students will form their groups and prepare their arguments in the group. Students are encouraged to use the new collaborative theatres and collaborative spaces available at UTS to facilitate the required collaborative group work for planning and presenting the debates. Students will be assessed by a panel of judges against the assessment criteria and receive feedback. Students should attend the Geology Practical and Soil Laboratory sessions and participate in the group activities to be able to prepare the corresponding practical and laboratory reports, which are parts of the overall assessment of the subject. The subject is organised so that maximum student oriented education is provided. In this case, students are strongly advised to attend all planned lecture and tutorial classes as timetabled. In this way, learning is optimised through collaboration with peers, conversation with instructor and thus accessing ongoing weekly feed forward suggestions which inform their ongoing learning and assessment tasks.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Introduction to soil engineering: typical problems, the engineer's role, the role of other professions in the study of the ground.

Tutorials (2 hours weekly) combined with recommended exercise problems, which students are encouraged to attempt before the tutorial. During tutorial classes, students will be guided to solve and analyse problems collaboratively. Supervised tests (1 every 2-3 weeks) will provide students with feedback on their learning progress and prepare them for the final examination. In addition, students are given 3-4 eTasks (assignments) to complete during the teaching session. The eTasks comprise challenging structural analysis problems and while students are encouraged to collaborate in discussing the solution concept, each student is given an individual data set and will make a separate submission. They have the opportunity to collaboratively discuss solution concepts with fellow students including during tutorial sessions to validate their assumptions and solution methodology. Each eTask will contain approximately 2 exercise problems that are based on material covered in the lectures, tutorial sessions and prescribed reading.

However, practitioners in some of the fields in the broad range of civil engineering do not undertake detailed structural design or are involved in the construction of structures. These civil engineers do not require the depth involved in the detail of structural design (assessment of loads, structural analysis, structural behaviour of different structural materials and the design requirements for different structural materials, in accordance with the relevant Australian Standards). This subject introduces students in certain streams of the civil engineering offerings &ndash; civil and environmental, civil/water &ndash; to the fundamentals of structural behaviour and design of reinforced concrete, structural steel and timber elements. This builds on the knowledge and competence already achieved on the structural analysis of statically determinate structures, internal actions induced by applied loads (axial force, shear force and bending moment) and the response of elements to these internal actions, such as strain and stress distributions across cross-sections. The detail and depth of this subject does not allow the students to attain a sufficient competence to undertake the structural analysis and basic design of anything more complex than simple structural components. The students should achieve sufficient understanding of structural behaviour and design to be able to recognise the basic structural implications that are reflected in the design and construction of structures that they may encounter in their careers as civil engineers in their particular field away from structural engineering.

Each workshop will introduce a topic before students apply the learning to their own projects. The studio format will be used to extend understanding and synthesize the knowledge acquired in different subjects from the Business Analytics course. The workshops will consist of a range of diverse tasks, including individual and group exercises, presentation practice, analytical exercises, assignment planning and drafting, and analytical skills training. During these workshops students will receive various types of feedback within a collegial, discursive learning context, from the fellow students as well as from the tutor. Students will collaborate through a process of constructive peer-review and discussion of each students&rsquo; submissions. They will complete pre-work before class in order to use the knowledge they have gained in a constructive manner during class. Students are expected to consult the program section of this subject outline for instructions regarding required pre-reading and preparation to be undertaken before each class. Workshop and pre-reading materials and activities for all workshops will be made available on Canvas. This studio will be an opportunity for professional practice as a researcher, and students should aim to produce a professional quality output, with mentoring from professionals. Students will find that during this studio process they will need to recognise that a variety of solutions are possible, rather than one prescribed approach being adopted. Students will find that there isn&rsquo;t one sequence to completing the task, and often the process will be iterative &ndash; that is students will run one project or experiment, realise the errors or missed opportunities, and then iterate on those to improve the outcome.

In the secondary sessions most weeks, tutorials or practical exercises will be held. The practicals provide learning experiences and practice in using equipment and are very important, as practical skills are an essential component of the learning and assessment of this subject. Field exercises will involve group work with either a group or individual submission as indicated on the class program. This provides an active learning experience. Each class is supported by information on UTSOnline including videos which will need to be consulted/previewed prior to attending class, and where necessary pre-class quizzes need to be completed.

Students will have two weeks to rehearse debating skills to use the gathered information to effect. The class materials are provided on UTSOnline (Canvas) before each weekly session with exercises attached for students to pose questions and reflect on their understanding and to bring this to class. In the class, the lecturer explains the complex background for each topic based on these UTSOnline (Canvas) materials and students use their sense-making to clarify their interpretations through dialogic feedback. Group discussions follow classes, in which students are given a question based on a case study. They use design thinking to define the problem and to come up with solution ideas that they present to the whole class. Students critique and evaluate each other&rsquo;s responses.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Defining sustainability as a multidimensional integrated complex phenomenon encompassing the environmental, social, technological, and economic domains.

Students study the evolution, architecture, functionality, and operation of wireless networking technologies that exist in the market today. These technologies include GSM (Global System Mobile), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), 3G UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), 4G, 5G, IoT and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). As part of the practical work, students set up and perform measurements on wireless networks and model the behaviour of the network and wireless propagation. Students work in groups and undertake a review of an emerging wireless technology and deliver a presentation and a report on it.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The subject delivery consists of tutorials, quizzes, presentations and practical work. It is the responsibility of the student to read UTSOnline regularly, view lecture videos, study the subject resources, and answer review questions. Past experience has shown that students who miss key learning activities have a high chance of failure. We expect that you play an active part in your learning in the subject and adhere to the principles of good academic practice as outlined in the Guide to good academic practice from the academic board. This means that you should come to all of the class sessions well prepared. Go through the lecture videos and subject resources BEFORE coming to class. Take an active part in the class and engage with the learning activities &ndash; do not simply be a passive observer! The exams and quizzes assume that you have completed the readings and lecture videos along with the lecture notes. UTSOnline will be used in this subject for subject resources and announcements. It is the responsibility of the student to read UTSOnline regularly. The teaching strategy consists of weekly classes made up of a one hour tutorial in which students are invited to clear doubts regarding the lecture material covered to date and material explored outside class. Design tasks are then undertaken to apply concepts. The practical tasks require students to work together in groups to set up and measure the performance of a wireless network.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell></Row><Row><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">49020</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Engineering and Information Technology</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Electrical and Data Engineering</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">6.000</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String"></Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This subject builds on knowledge gained in the subject 49048 Wireless Networking Technologies.

Sensor technology is a key part of IoT, which is experiencing a rapid growth and is believed to be a multi-billion dollar industry. Wireless sensor networks are distributed systems, in which autonomous devices, sometimes called Motes, collect environmental data (such as location, speed, temperature, humidity and sound level) or, more recently, medical data (such as heart rate, blood oxygen level and pulse rate). This data is collected across a network, aggregated and fed into business applications. Sensor networks are an enabler for a broad range of applications in different sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, mining, smart cities, etc. In this subject, students will learn WSN theory and technology such as routing and security as well as hands-on skills and practical knowledge in WSN.</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Autumn session, City campus</Data></Cell><Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lab tutorials complement classes. Students will practice new knowledge and skills they will need in the workplace such as interpersonal, time management, and communications written and oral by writing academic reports, delivering presentation and receiving detailed feedback.

Encourage student&rsquo;s multicultural collaborations inside the classroom/lab to foster the valuing and awareness of diverse perspectives (international, multicultural&hellip;) Industry-focused projects are designed to engage students in real-world challenges such as precision farming. During lab tutorials, students will be required to work collaboratively on research inspired and Industry-focused assignments that are designed to encourage students to build their transdisciplinary and research skills. They can develop creativity and complex problem solving skills through conducting literature survey, brain storm, discuss about current challenges, generate ideas and finally propose solutions. Continuous feedback is provided in class and is critical to this teaching-learning environment. Students will integrate how they used feedback to make further progress on their work. Lab tutorials also develop hands on skills such as programming and hardware implementation. Students are required to design and implement a sensor network using hardware (raspberry pi, sensor) and software, create a demo of their work, conduct experiments and troubleshoot the sensor network. Classes are interactive learning environments in which students will engage with practical and real-world examples from latest theoretical and technological advances. Animations, diagrams, conversations and exercises are designed to both bring concepts to life and to offer opportunities for feedback and to encourage deeper understanding. Learning in these interactive classes aims to prepare students for the quizzes and online exam which is designed to include learners from different backgrounds and provide students with opportunities to demonstrate how they apply their understanding of subject learning objectives.
